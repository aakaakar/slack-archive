After some rough initial measurements (and creating setup automation for AWS and implementing some telemetry), we are planning to do some \"serious\" performance testing on fabric. As there still seem not to be too much support for this in the code base - busywork is nice and we are looking at it, but does not seem to address all aspects - my question is this: what harness\/automation do you use for performance measurement and\/or benchmarking? Does anyone already have patches for telemetry that could be shared? (I seem not to be able top see the archive of the channel, so apologies if earlier posts would answer my question...)",
