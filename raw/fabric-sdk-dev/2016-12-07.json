Our contract platform has used JSON for event and state for the last 10 months, with a schema describing the payloads so that applications can self-configure mappings or forms.

We also have classifiers so that \"read all assets\" can see only the correct asset class, and filters, date ranges and history with same. I'm a big fan of JSON in this role.",
