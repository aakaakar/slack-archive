Developers should be able to test their chaincode without needing to deploy the chaincode to the network. \nApplication development\n\t\tFabric SDK should enable developers to write applications that can interact with the network in various ways. Applications may invoke\/query chaincodes, listen to the events generated by the network, retrieve information about the blocks and transactions stored in the ledger etc.\nWell documented api(s), data models, and sample code\nSDK should provide clearly written documentation regarding the available apis, data models, and examples illustrating how the apis can be used.\nEase of use\n\t\tChaincode developers and application developers are concerned with writing business logic. Even though it is advantageous for developers to be familiar with internals of fabric project, it should not be a prerequisite.  As such, SDK should not have any compile time dependencies on fabric project (other than the proto files that define various contracts). SDK packages\/jars\/libraries should be made available through well known repositories so that developers can easily install them and start writing chaincode developing applications right away.\n \f\nWhat is the difference between Chaincode and Application code?\n\n\tBoth chaincode and application code contain business logic.  The main difference is where the code is deployed.\n\tChaincode is deployed on the network and can read\/write world state using api provided by SDK. \n\tApplication code is not deployed on the network. Applications will use the SDK to invoke the chaincode deployed on the network, listen to various events generated by the network, query transactions and blocks present in the ledger.",
