        "text": "<@U13TWBRBL> - I am trying to figure out how to set an Event registration to ensure receipt of all transactions going to a raw Ledger and their commit status. The subtext of this is that the response would need to include the Ledger \/ channel \/ chain that the transactions are for. In registering for Block events  - 1) would I receive the rejected transactions? 2) Would the info returned include the Ledger it is for?",

        "text": "<@U13TWBRBL> - The event.proto file has removed the Transaction event type and seems to replace it with a Rejection event type. I am presuming that this is generated as part of the Committer functionality, and would require a separate registration to receive. Please confirm.   Also the common.proto has a BlockMetadataIndex that contains a Transactions_Filter which states it is for a bitarray filter of invalid transactions. Does this mean that invalid transactions will be returned within the Block events?",
