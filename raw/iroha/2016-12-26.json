        "text": "Hi, i use docker image hyperledger\/iroha-build and then start 4 peers with the script run-iroha-build.sh. Then i invoke \/account\/register (with curl on one peer) to create accounts. It works fine :slightly_smiling_face:. i see propagation on the 3 others peers in logs and    a get on \/account?uuid= retrieve the account. After that, i test to stop 2 peers and  if i have understand the 2f+1 algorithm, i was expecting that it will not succeed to achieved the consensus and so fail to register account. But it still works ...I miss the point. Another question, i only see \/asset\/operation on server side (http_server_with_cappuccino.cpp) but \/asset\/create route existe in iroha-android project. It is because it is still in development phase for the moment? Thanks you. PS : IROHA architecture looks simple with a nice signed transactions events mechanism. congrats.",
