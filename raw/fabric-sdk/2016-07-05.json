Even though I see the continous work, I am not aware of the development practices that for example guarantee that whatever markdown file I am reading atm, it will correctly describe the state of the repository in that moment. Also, why do we still promote the old marbles demo, when the sdk in it is deprecated so to say? Normally I would have repositories separately for the hyperledger, the sdks, the chaincode related stuff and maybe even the documentation, but that also depends on what people are doing. \nAlso, the more I read this thing the more it seems that this is basically an IBM internal project, almost everyone here on slack who is active seems to be IBM related persons",
