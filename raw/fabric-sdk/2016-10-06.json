        "text": "<@U1AASP2SJ>  - the good news is there is nothing especially fancy about how TLS communication works between a client and either membersrvc or the peer.   On the client side, it comes down to 2 things:\n\n1) Trusting the TLS server certificate used by membersrvc and\/or the peer(s).  This can be done by either explicitly trusting the server certificate or by trusting the root certificate(s) used by the CA which issued the TLS server cert.\n\n2) Determine whether or not you are going to do hostname verification (which of course is the default for TLS client stacks) and in that case you need to ensure that the CN and\/or SAN for the TLS server cert used by membersrvs and\/or the peer matches the FQDN you use to access it from your client",
