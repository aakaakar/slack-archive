I'm trying to learn a bit more about the blockchain ecosystem. \nIn reading a few arch (like FAB-37 docs), I could not understand the pre-reqs a client should keep in mind before venturing into development \/ deployment of the fabric. And how it would integrate \/ communicate with smart contracts.\nIs there some information available that explains what the peer needs to have in order to carry out various transactions for endorsing, commits, etc.?\nI also see a mention of HSM for crypto. I also see ACL, CC2CC. But where can I find more details on security.\nOr perhaps I'm looking at it the wrong way. The framework provides the means, it's really left to the org to implement the protocols as needed for their use case.",
