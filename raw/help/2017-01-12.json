        "text": "<@U3LH9V41L>  I've seen this where people are trying to use the v0.6 branch of the code and then are following the instructions in the v0.6 branch of the documentation, but....get twisted up because there are a couple spots in this doc where it has a wget (for the chaincode) and a git clone (for getting the fabric code available locally in order to build the chaincode) that refer to *master*.   The problem is, that *master* is now v1.0 code.    So, they are running Docker images with v0.6 code but when they build the chaincode locally, it incorporates v1.0 code in into it.   The solution is, in the *wget* and the *git clone*,  change *master* to *v0.6* in the path name.   I am being purposely vague as to where this documentation is, because if I've guessed correctly, you know what I'm referring to, but if I've guessed wrong, it's something else and I don't want to lead you on a wild goose chase.   I hope this helps.",
