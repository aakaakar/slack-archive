I appriciate if you could answer.\n\n- What is TLSCA? What's the purpose? How it does being used?\n\n- What is ACA (Attribute CA) and ACert (Attribute Certificate)? What is the purpose? How it does being used?\n\n- Regarding the ECA and TCA, should they be certified by root CA? if so, where is the root CA?\n\n- Should root CA be signed by a external CA which is the outsitde of the Blockchain network?",
