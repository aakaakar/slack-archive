I have been obsessed with the need for a quick way to find the divergent block and decode the transactions, gathering all data from all peers into one message. I really got into in on the weekend and finished it up today. Here is the node-red flow (with 3 sub flows) for that: <https:\/\/github.com\/ibm-watson-iot\/blockchain-samples\/tree\/master\/testing\/node-red\/fabricDivergentBlockFinder> ... use this to quickly diagnose your divergence issues. If there are errors on one or more peers, you may be experiencing the issues we've been seeing. But if there are no transaction errors and your hash diverges anyway, then look to your chaincode as a possible (more likely probable) source for the divergence (as in non-deterministic behavior.)",
