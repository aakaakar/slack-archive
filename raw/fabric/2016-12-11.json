For example, using HFC, I get a \"complete\" event when the transaction completes successfully, but I only get \"error\" once HFC has timed out and it has guessed that the transaction has failed.  My use case is for example attempting to transfer an asset from person X to person Y and that failing say for permissions reasons.  The transferring party\/parties should be notified not only when the failure happens but the reason for failure as well.",
