I\u2019ve deployed, invoked, and queried the example chaincode [<https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/tree\/master\/examples\/chaincode\/chaintool\/example02>] using the REST API and have moved onto the asset management chaincode [<https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/tree\/master\/examples\/chaincode\/go\/asset_management>]. However, I can\u2019t seem to figure out how to interact with this chaincode via the REST API. Are there any documented REST calls for it \/ has anyone successfully done this themselves? Many thanks! cc: <@U197CR6BF> <@U196W47SL>",
