For example, if I have three parties (Party A, Party B, and Party C) and all parties run validating peers, is there a way for Party A to transact with Party B without Party C being able to see the content of the transaction?\n\nAs I understand it, in the hybrid approach, validators can decrypt all of the transactions, so Party A and Party B would not be able to initiate transactions without party C being able to decrypt them. The transactions in this case would be hidden from Users that are transacting through NVP, but the VP would have full visibility into the transactions.\n\nIs this correct?",
