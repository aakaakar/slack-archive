        "text": "general question:  am referring the auction use case ( bcoz am planning to implement similar usecase on fabric ), in auction use case the items are moving from one person to other person when we query its shows only the current worldstate of the chain so question is  1) if i want to see complete audit trail for an item how can i query in fabric 2) when a record get stored in block it will have hash for that block, so when show the complete audit trail for an item i believe i should show the records with corresponding block hash, is my understanding is correct? 3) is it possible to get complete audit trail for an item by query block chain any time or do i need to store transaction in external db's by getting hash from block chain when write transaction into blockchain 4) for same use case is it possible to store the image in block chain  ( consider my image size will be more than 20MB ) and get a hash for it and refer same hash in actual transaction\n\nAppreciate your response in advance :slightly_smiling_face:  your reply will really help me to implement use cases",
