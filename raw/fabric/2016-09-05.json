        "text": "<@U268EB76W> - sure.  It is really when you start to combine things like Linux, bridge interfaces, overlay networks, Docker and Swarm that things get interesting.  Here's a few examples:\n\n1) The Linux kernel has a hard-coded limit of 1024 virtual interfaces per bridge interface.  This is of course sort-of known if you know Linux networking and you can work around it by creating multiple bridge interfaces.   But - now let's say you want to use Docker's built-in overlay network driver AND the containers needs to connect to external networks.  This results in a bridge network network being created automatically and overlay networks can only use this bridge network.  End result:   as far as we can tell, using the Docker overlay driver results in a limit of 1023 containers per host\n\n2) Docker Swarm calls RefreshNetwork as part of every CreateContainer call.  The larger the number of containers on the overlay network, the more expensive this call becomes and the longer it takes to start each container.  (FYI - looks like there is a fix for this in the current master branch for Swarm and we'll take a look at that)\n\n3) There are a number of other setting which we have learned about via trial and error as well:\n\n- parameters like `net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1`, `net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2`,`net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3` need to be set much higher than the defaults in order to avoid arp table overruns\n\n- parameters like `vm.dirty_ratio` and `vm.dirty_background_ratio` need to be properly set to lower values when you have a lot of containers which write to disk else Ubuntu will hang due to task timeouts\n\nThe reality is that there really is no documentation \/ documented best practices of trying to run things like Swarm at massive scale when you need things like overlay networks, have stageful containers, etc.",

For the last several months I've been using Bluemix IBM Blockchain (your baby) for my technical education sessions teaching engineers how to develop chaincode, build Hyperledger Fabric, and soon how to architect for real-world blockchain\/chaincode applications. This helps confirm some of my suspicions. Personally, I advise clients against swarm unless they have use cases that suit it, otherwise, I have found other proprietary ways to get around  the scaling, discovery, and inter\/intra-container communication issues. Did you read the PR from Verizon stating they successfully cranked an IoT infrastructure running 40,000 docker containers? It was to be their platform for competing in the IoT space.",
