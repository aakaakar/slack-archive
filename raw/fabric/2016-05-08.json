And it is written to RocksDB at some point (this is a question). I could not understand the condition when and who writes into the DB.  As for writing the DB, looks like each \"peer\" process writes to rocksDB based on current world state, and world state is synced frequently within a network.  If wring to DB is correct, question is a condition of writing to the DB.  This came to my mind what will happen \"when 1 peer has lost the connection due to the power outage or data center maintenance for 1 day, and can it recover the world state?\"  The last test might be able to done in local env.",
