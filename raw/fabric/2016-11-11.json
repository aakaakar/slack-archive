When they choose Fabric, a bunch of them will decide to actually run the \"nodes \/ peers\" which make up the network.   They'll build and deploy chaincode to solve their business domain and then build applications which submit transactions \/ query the blockchain for data.\n\nThere's nothing which would prevent a single network from serving multiple business domains, it would all depend on the needs \/ business models of the participants for any given network.  Of course some industries have regulations which would inherent require a more closed \/ private network so you'll end up with multiple networks in the end",
