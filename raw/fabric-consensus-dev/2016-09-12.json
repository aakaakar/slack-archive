There is a common theme: cryptography and resilient protocols have to withstand a class of attacks, the protocol or my cryptosystem may run *much* faster if there is no attack, but it's hard to demonstrate which attacks\/situations it survives. Essentially this requires mathematical arguments. Unlike, say, designing a faster network, which demonstrates its feature by operation and measuring the speed. In crypto and consensus protocols you can only demonstrate the *failure* of achieving a claimed goal, and such an attack is hard work. Therefore the protocol has to be peer-reviewed just like a cryptosystem. Othewise just don't bother.",
