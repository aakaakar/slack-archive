Kafka use ZK for some pieces of coordination (although they have lots of other stuff built into the brokers as well) and unfortunately it has proven hard to completely eliminate the tie to ZK with Kafka.   My (potentially misguided) mention of Raft assumed that we built our own \"broadcast\" piece (i.e. our own Kafka) and that we would still need a mechanism to coordinate those processes (which is where I would the the Raft library to start with)",
