Check out section 4-   see how the hashes are at the Block level, not per transaction?  While implementation details differ, this is conceptually what Fabric is doing as well-  that's why we need blocks.   If you set your configuration parameters for max of 1 transaction per block, you would \"in essence\" be chaining at the transaction level, but it would still be wrapped by \"blocks\".   (Of course you might be killing yourself performance-wise depending on your expected transaction volume but that's a different story)",
