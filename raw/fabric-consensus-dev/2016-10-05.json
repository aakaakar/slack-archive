I probably need to test it more to get more details, what I believe I saw was the node with bad network will first find itself out of sync, then the weak certs it receives are out of its high watermark, then it will initiate view change request. However, if the network is again bombarded with txs during view change request, the problem node will go panic (I am gonna see if increasing the log size will get better luck).....anyways, a node shouldn't go panic due to network problem",
