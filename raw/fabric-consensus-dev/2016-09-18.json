For example, say the ledger is used by the chaincode to hold an orderbook, with offers constantly changing at high frequency. It is likely that clients will be submitting to different peers at around the same time transactions that will modify the tip of the orderbook. My reading of the design document is that this will frequently lead to the `STALE_VERSION` endorsement being returned. \nRipple\u2019s approach to this issue is to group a set of transactions into a batch which are processed in a hard to predict determinisitc order and loose time constraints dictate which transactions get into which batch. I\u2019d be very interested to hear any views on this potential issue :slightly_smiling_face: \n<https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/blob\/master\/proposals\/r1\/Next-Consensus-Architecture-Proposal.md#41-batch-and-block-formation> discusses this a little, but it seems that the batching occurs after endorsement?",
