        "text": "Hello. I hope this is the place to ask about this. I am trying to test the Java chaincode example. I have followed the Docker based approach, not vagrant. I have experience dealing with dockers and use new Docker for Mac. My problems is that in \"Java Chaincode Setup\" part of the docs explains that I need to use \"vagrant\", which I didn't install as I want to go directly to the Docker \/ docker-compose approach. Is there a way to get into Java chaincode development without using vagrant? Also, second question, I see that the example references $GOHOME when talking about gradle. Do I need to use GO lang to deal with Java chaincode programming? Of course any addional docs con Java chaincode will be welcome. Thanks a lot.",
