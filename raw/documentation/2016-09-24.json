        "text": "I am not sure if this was already addressed but it looks like the current documentation in readthedocs does not mention different ready-made deployment topologies encoded into .yml files based in .\/bddtests\/bdd-docker folder. One may deduce what certain files provide but if a short description of each .yml file would be added, it would definitely help people step straight into a scenario they wish to test their chaincode against. The current documentation promotes single-peer deployment with noops for simplicity but I am pretty sure many people would like to have similarly detailed description of popular deployments (such as chaincode example02) with, let's say, 4-node deployment with pbft and CA.",
