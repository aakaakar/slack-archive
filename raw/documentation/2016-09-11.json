If Membership Services cease to function correctly, no certificates are issued and thus, no transactions can be processed and no new members can be enrolled. I would develop this topic further to highlight that there is a possibility to set up highly available or redundant membership services nodes in two geographically separated locations: <http:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/FAQ\/identity_management_FAQ\/>",
