Some of these I think I know the answers to but it's always good to get confirmation. \n\n1) Is the fabric only being developed \"for business\"? In other words, will this specific blockchain fabric be usable for the public at large? Say, someone who wants to buy something from Amazon.

What I was trying to say is that even if the average individual customer doesn't really \"use\" a fabric like this -- at least not knowingly or directly -- it's possible Amazon might use blockchain as part of a transaction that a customer is making.
