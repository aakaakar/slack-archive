In response, you transformed that static file into a web form (in gerrit I suppose). Now that I have a bit of time I could edit it and have it ready for public use. Unfortunately, Slack does not allow me to scroll back with history and I cannot see a direct link you gave me. If you still have it in your records I would greatly appreciate if you can send it again to me.",
