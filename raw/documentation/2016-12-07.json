If you have the fabric 0.6 codebase cloned and then you `vagrant ssh` you should be able to compile the chaincode and then deploy to your peer running locally.  Please ensure that you DON'T have the current master branch cloned in your GOPATH.  If you\u2019re still getting stuck please share your logs and I will help you resolve",
