It adds complication due to the extra layer of abstraction, and as a result we are re-factoring the documentation to emphasize docker (in the works\u2026)  Try using the docker approach, it\u2019s a much simpler format.  You simply save a docker-compose.yaml file (there are samples further down that page you are on) and then run ```docker-compose up``` from whichever directory you saved it to.  It will spin up a few containers for your peers and for the Certificate Authority.  Then you can register a chaincode with a peer or launch one  as a container.  Let me know if you need help with a Docker approach.",
