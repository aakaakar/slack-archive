In <http:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/dev-setup\/devenv\/> the following is written with regards to the host: \"Note that your Host should not run within a VM. If you attempt this, the VM within your Host may fail to boot with a message indicating that VT-x is not available.\". That may imply that only physical hosts are accepted for this deployment. However, I managed to deploy it on an Ubuntu VM hosted on ESXi 6.0 with hardware virtualization activated through advanced settings (\"vhv.enable='true'\") which is a common option used to create nested virtualization environment with VMware software.",
