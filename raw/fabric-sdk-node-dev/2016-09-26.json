        "text": "<@U12452RAP> Kai, I added the following explanation to the PR comment in response to your question:\n\nThe main reason to remove typescript is to simplify the tool chain in the contributor's development environment. the original motivation for using TypeScript on the node.js SDK project revolved around it's affordance for code structure constructs such as interfaces and classes. while that can be easily achieved with much simpler prototype based javascript techniques as demonstrated in base.js. along with CommonJS modules we can have the equivalence of interfaces and classes rather easily.\n\nfor strong typing, I don't think it's a big problem really. I've been on large projects completely based on node.js (one of them made up of 10+ separate microservices projects) and enforcing types using documentation and communication is more than enough. relying on unit tests to enforce types is a much better mechanism.\n\nhope this helps.",
