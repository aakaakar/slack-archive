See FAB-1593. \nI commented out all unit  tests from gulp test  but headless-tests, and it's still broken.  \nGulp test-headless works, but the coverage report says 100% coverage.  This is not plausible.\n\nI backed up to sprint 5 video commit levels.   At these levels, \ngulp test-headless works, and the coverage report is plausible.\ngulp test works in the sense it drives all the UTs.  Quite a few tests fail, but gulp doesn't fail as in FAB-1593. The coverage report is plausible. \n\nTrying to figure out what changed.",
