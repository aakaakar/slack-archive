All tests ran sucessfully, so I expect to be re-enable the failing tests in the run-unit-tests.sh script once the fix is merged\n- still waiting on 1305 and 1307 to be merged so that I can roll the updated unit tests back to v0.6 and complete FAB-595. I'd really like to get this off my plate so i can start fixing issues that have cropped up in the tests.\n- working with ramesh to get a stable vLaunch environment for jenkins. Consequently fixed a problem in install.hfc.sh <https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=0Bzx4N50uIUwnTUVFRGFIdEdsM0E>\n  I think it's very stable at this point.   I requested a new VM with an Ubuntu 16.04 image, on which I installed the fabric code. I intend to start using this env for testing\n- will continue to look at FAB-595 to setup tests for fabric-sdk-node",
