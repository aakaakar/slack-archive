My next door neighbor had a big fire break out in her household and we spent quite some time with her outside so she is not out there by herself during this event. So I will be coming into office a bit later tomorrow as it is now the middle of the night\u2026\n\nMy status: I have incorporated all the changes Bret and I have made for the Orderer class and the associated unit tests. I made sure all the tests are running to my satisfaction. I have opened the PR here and it\u2019s ready for review: <https:\/\/gerrit.hyperledger.org\/r\/#\/c\/1681\/1>\n\nBret, I\u2019ll try to be in around 10 and we can begin debugging your connection issue from the Member class. The plan is to make progress on that code, add any remaining tests, and open another PR with Bret on that on Wednesday. \n\nThanks!",

It looks like two calls are not meant to be invoked by clients, so that leaves 13 methods not tested.  Today I will try to learn why so many methods have no UT coverage.",
