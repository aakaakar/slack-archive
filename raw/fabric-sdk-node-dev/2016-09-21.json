It forces us to install additional development packages, introducing confusion on how to work with available javascript packages, and .d.ts files, and a compilation step. A lot of our developers and testers are still confused by the fact that editing the resulting .js file during testing does NOT save your changes as the source files are still actually in .ts. Therefore, modifying your .js files during testing\/debugging would lead you to loose your changes. A lot of developers are also still much more familiar with javascript than typescript and that makes adoption\/maintenance of the project more difficult.",
