Is there a way to set up Docker-compose networks that will not require the hyperledger-fabric image  to *ever* be rebuilt as the peer and membersrvc are updated during develoment? I\u2019m thinking, can we use Docker volumes to simply mount a common GOPATH into the container instead of rebuilding the GOPATH?",
