We use prototype inheritance which allows the use of a flexible list of attributes, maybe you will find it useful. Definitely relevant to the blockchain discussion once we get out of the pure automation (=smart contracts) and into the real world with actual contracts.",

To be honest, I tend to find a specific country or demographic and name it. It'd be lazy of me not to do that. Whatever statistics I quote will be based on a specific demography anyway. If I were to coin a term, I would call it the \"latent majority\" with more of a ring of when innovation is adopted as opposed to imposing a power hierarchy on the world.",
