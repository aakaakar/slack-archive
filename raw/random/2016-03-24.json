A Security and Identity solution at the baseline level is what will transform access to banking....reputation systems, credit scores, mobile banking, cashless transacting and ultimately less predatory lending. Today, 90% of the population in Colombia use cash (govmt wants to change this), in Venezuela they don't even have cash. Of course, LATAM is only but a fraction of the Majority World....but that near and dear to me.  As you may already know, the World Bank is actively looking at Blockchain~!",

One of the broad requests from the last event was that we needed better understanding of the use cases and problems from a broader perspective than the mostly western developers.
