They are slow and large (43K signature! but the public and private keys are small), but have some provable security and decades of research. The latest IETF proposal is <https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/draft-irtf-cfrg-xmss-hash-based-signatures\/> and a reference implementation is at <http:\/\/www.square-up.org\/downloads\/xmss_2016-03-08.tar.gz>.
