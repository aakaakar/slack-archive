Figure out a good process for release management\n    - Frequent minor releases, with effective use of git tags to make it easier to provide stable releases to the community.\n    - Use conventions such as 'RC's to tag progress appropriately.\n3. Build, tag and push docker images to an appropriate registry service.\n    - Maintain a clear correspondence between git tags and docker image tags\n4. Deployment methods we'd like to support:\n    - Docker compose\n    - Ansible\/chef scripts\n5. Automated testing\n    - Which cloud service do we use?\n    - Integration test strategies for the network\n\t   - What else should we cover beyond what we already do today?",
