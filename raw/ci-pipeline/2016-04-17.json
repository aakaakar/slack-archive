I used <http:\/\/bluemix.net|bluemix.net> to deploy the bot. It needs a Slack API token, a Github API token and we\u2019ll probably want to get a Bluemix account to deploy this and any other bots unless we want to establish something that LF hosts (but then we have a bit more work to do to set up HA and fail-over, etc. that Bluemix (Cloud Foundry) provides out of the box. I will inquire about getting a pro bono account. I\u2019ll also put together complete deploy instructions.",
