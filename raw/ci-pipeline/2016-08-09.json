And after this we should just set that environment variable on the Jenkins machines.",

Said issue seems to exhibit itself mostly with `@issue 1000 - chaincode example02 with 4 peers and 1 membersrvc, test crash fault`. What happens is that sometimes when the peers come back up they get new IPs and the root VP still tries to connect to the old IPs.\nI've created an issue on Jira to track it: <https:\/\/jira.hyperledger.org\/browse\/FAB-5>",
