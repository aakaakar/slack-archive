        "text": "<@U0KM61BCP> regarding PR 1671, I had discussion with <@U0KPFAZNF> and here is the summary of it.. (please bear with it as its quite descriptive)\n\nwith the initial changes suggested by <@U0KPFAZNF> to generalize and use fabric-baseimage &amp; openjdk8 in <http:\/\/Dockerfile.in|Dockerfile.in>, we see a build issue on x86. This is because we are using Ubuntu 14.04 for x86 baseimage which doesn't have Java8. But that is a pre-req for Java Shim.\n\nSo approach with very little deviation would be to use baseimage for Power and z as they use Ubuntu 16.04 for baseimage and continue with existing code for x86 until we bump the base OS to 16.04 for x86. This was agreed by <@U0KPFAZNF> provided you are in agreement too.\n\nNow the point is either to go with my first patchset-1 or use 2 <http:\/\/Dockerfiles.in|Dockerfiles.in> based on your last comment. In the latter case, we would still need to have ARCH condition in Makefile so leaves it no different than my approach in patchset-1. Moreover, having two Dockerfiles with almost same contents will lead to violation of DRY \/ proliferation of code and doesn\u2019t help getting rid of ARCH condition check in Makefile.\n \n<@U0KPFAZNF> is convinced either ways. So request your consent on the initial approach.",
