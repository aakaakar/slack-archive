        "text": "Hi all! Noob question: I want to evaluate building apps on hyperledger. I've started with <https:\/\/github.com\/IBM-Blockchain\/learn-chaincode> and compiled the example chaincode. However I aborted because I felt like I have to know more about the different blockchain implementations withing hyperledger first. How does fabric compare to sawtooth? What other blockchain implementations are there, and what use cases do the address specificly?\n- My preferred (but not only) use case is IoT related, e.g. have a device react to the state of a smart contract\n- I like the idea of ethereum's solidity as a special purpose language for smart contracts",
