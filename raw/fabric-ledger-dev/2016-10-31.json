Good to know you were able to get it resolved by rebuilding the peer. Do you get any error around following  \n```Couch DB Error: invalid_json```\nerror after the build image related error? I am getting this when trying to deploy a transaction as described in <https:\/\/lists.hyperledger.org\/pipermail\/hyperledger-fabric\/2016-October\/000421.html> .",

        "text": "Yes, that is expected for now, it happens since not all chaincode (e.g. lifecycle chaincode) is json based.  next step we are working on is to add non-json (binary) support when using CouchDB.  I think eventually we\u2019ll want to specify per chaincode which chaincode runs  on key\/value store (e.g. embedded rocksdb\/leveldb key\/value store) and which chaincode runs on CouchDB.  would make sense for lifecycle chaincode to run on embedded key\/value store and have business chaincode run in CouchDB for queryability",
