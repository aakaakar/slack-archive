As I understand from the code in Convergence branch, the current fsblkstorage package implements a file based storage for storing block data and a rocksdb is used for just indexing the data. If we are going to use CouchDB as an alternate database, I am assuming we will be replacing the file based block storage and the rocksdb indexing with the CouchDB specific implementation of storing blocks and the corresponding indexing of the data. Please correct me if I am wrong.",

The pluggable portion will just be the \u2018state database\u2019.  This is the part that chaincode actually interacts with.",
