I understand with the ECerts &amp; TCerts I might be able to manually decrpyt transactions, but that\u00b4s not provided as a service by Hyperledger. It\u00b4s not really convenient and you should also locally story which TCert you have used with which particular transaction. I am thinking more about a standard service (such as Query, Invoke, Deploy, etc.) where I may ask for all my transactionhistory for a particular ChainCode via an ECert ...",
