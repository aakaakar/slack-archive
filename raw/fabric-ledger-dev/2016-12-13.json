I have few questions regarding use the couchdb as rocksdb replacement. maybe I missed the couchdb related design doc, it would be helpful to let me understand if you can provide the link. 1. Have any motivation to let us move to use another kv db? more easy to query? or more easy to save the state with different document obj like json in our chaincode? I want to understand the benefit. 2. If we have multiple vps in the network, will the vps connect to same couchdb instance? or we have to maintain separate stuff on each vp. 3. If we update document out side vps, for example update the state via couchdb api directly. Will it effect the state consistency or consensus or what ever?",
