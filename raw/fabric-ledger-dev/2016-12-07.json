If you cleverly structured your chaincode function calls such that the asset id was always somehow passed in as a parameter (or even the full JSON was passed in as a parameter), you could read all the blocks and parse them to build this out of band.  Of course this is kinda crappy because we can only query 1 block at a time.  The other option would be to build this history in near real-time (again outside) but building an event listener and building the history from those events",
