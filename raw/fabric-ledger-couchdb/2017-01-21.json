(also looking at the Indexing capability that can be explored)\n2.  ` is that you can then use the query system chaincode (qscc) GetQueryResult() to perform rich queries against the ledger data `, Did you mean to say ` GetQueryResult `  API will also be available for the user chaincode?\n3. Is QSCC a newly introduced system chain-code for V1.0 or this will be used by Endorsing Peer whenever there is KV world-state operation irrespective of the type of KV-ledger used?\n4. Will couch-DB process be part of the Peer Image or we would be able to launch a separate docker-container dedicated for Couch-DB?",
