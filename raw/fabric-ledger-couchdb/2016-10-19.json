At this time we have not modified the source, and in that case the I felt the source should be pulled down outside the hyperledger\/fabric directory so that the src was not included with git.  BUT there is a possibility that we may have some custom config and customizations which should be added to the git repository and in that case it should be included.  We may just need a temporary path until some development and architecture decisions are made. <@U0KPFAZNF> Greg, if you would please provide some input in the review.  Thank you.",
