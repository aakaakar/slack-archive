Since the viewchangepeiod is 0, view changes only happens when one of the other 3 nodes fails, then the viewchagne starts and the synchronization begins. In my guess, when you send 60 transactions, one of the other fine nodes went down, and viewchange occurs and everybody catched up. I am just not sure why this round number, becuase as far as the sourcecode reveals, there is no such settup.",
