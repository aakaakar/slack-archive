Is it possible to join a new VP after the existing nodes already have blocks?\n\nE.g.\n1. I start with 4 VPs (vp1, vp2, vp3, vp4).\n2. Deploy chaincode, all 4 VPs create a new image and run create a new chaincode attaches to itself.\n3. Pump transactions, all 4 VPs update its chain.\n4. Join a new node as vp5, all existing 4 VPs know the newly join node, discovery list got updated, all 5 VPs connection seemed to be fine.\n\n**Problem**\nAny new transaction, will not affect to the vp5, but only old 4VPs.",
