How are they kept in sync?\n\nWhen we say consenters 'validate the integrity' of the transaction, what does this mean?\n\nWhy does having a consenters increase transaction throughput, was the previous throughput limit constraint solely due to it needing to speak to all the nodes?\n\nDo both endorsers and consenters have a copy of the ledger, who stores it?",
