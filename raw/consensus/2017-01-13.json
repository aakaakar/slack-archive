        "text": "There is gRPC error from orderer when it tries to send the Deploy Transaction Block to Peer. Port exposed by peer by default is 7051. However orderer uses the right docker container IP of Commiter Peer (which is also endorser for 1 Peer Setup) but a different port (48144 and randomly in increasing order). This results in write broken pipe error. How does Orderer know about the list of Committer Peers (IP, Port) on the Hyperledger network, is there a way can provide more debug information or is there a known solution?\n\nSetup: Fabric {peer, cop and orderer} images are used from the connect-a-thon - v1.0 architecture and is currently used to run a custom-helloworld-chaincode  using DEV mode.\n\nSecondly - I have tried this on Linux box hosted on AWS and has never seen this problem however on our internal organization boxes (Intranet one of the environment difference), we see this error almost frequently.",
