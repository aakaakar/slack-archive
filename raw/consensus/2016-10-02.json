The spec (<https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/blob\/master\/docs\/protocol-spec.md#3473-committing-and-rolling-back-transactions>) talks about `CommitTxBatch` but it's not clear at what point transactions are bundled to create a block. Also, what prevents a same node from creating blocks always?",
