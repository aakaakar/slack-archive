Questions - 1) Where is the code in the node sdk in reference to the protobufmessagesandflow.pdf doc? It appears not to have implemented this. 2) There appears to be no concept of dynamic endorsers (where the endorsers are defined by the client or context of the information. Is this planned on being supported? 3) There is no concept of channels yet. Any idea when it will be reflected? 4) How is external peer information expected to be configured \/ maintained?",
