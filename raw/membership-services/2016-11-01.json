As a high-level application developer, the things I found particularly interesting: that COP is built on CloudFlare\u2019s SSL library, which is why the interface is changing from GRPC to REST. Details here on Jira: <https:\/\/jira.hyperledger.org\/browse\/FAB-763>, and here\u2019s the CFSSL codebase and docs: <https:\/\/github.com\/cloudflare\/cfssl>. FIPS certification would be great for us at Everledger. Feels like things are going really well, nice one everyone :slightly_smiling_face:",
