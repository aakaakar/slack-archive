        "text": "<@U2Y2V95D2> - technically the data is not \"lost\" (meaning it is not deleted \/ removed) and would still be accessible from the chaincode associated with it.  But what you are really asking is whether or not Fabric supports upgrading chaincode.   Up through v0.6.x, the answer is no (unless you are working in development mode).  In v1 (which is what is under current development) the answer is yes and this does mean that you are actually \"replacing\" the previous chaincode with new chaincode and it will have access to the same data",
