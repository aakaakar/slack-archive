I tried to run the example node.js in starter container to add user \"JohnDoe\" predefined in the code and found no problem when running. As I noticed, after running, member.JohnDoe file was created in \/tmp\/keyValstore directory but I can't use the enrollment secret located in the file to enroll that user via RESTAPI.  \"Error\": \"rpc error: code = 2 desc = Identity or token does not match.\", it said.  The status of this user is also not logged in. Could someone please advice on this? Thanks\n\nP.S. As I noticed, there is ecert_JohnDoe file generated in \/tmp folder in membersrvc node but no enrollment.key file generated in \/var\/hyperledger\/production\/crypto\/client\/JohnDoe\/ks\/raw folder in peer node.",
