When chaincode returns error (i.e. failed for smartcontact agreement, it return \"return nil, err\", and at the same time Node SDK client listens transaction invoke via &lt;transaction-context&gt;('complete', function) and &lt;transaction-context&gt;('error', function), the error goes to &lt;transaction-context&gt;('error', function) process, right ?   Or does it go to 'complete' ? In latter case, I think I need to check if transaction has failed or somehow.",
