Do we need handling in the config parser for it? At one point we could just throw anything in the json file and it would magically appear wherever you wanted to grab it in the code. <@U0YQQRNU8> is that still the case or is that locked down?\nAs this is kind of a stepping stone to a more interesting policy, I'd like to avoid too many hurdles to get the whitelist to the txn family validation logic.",
