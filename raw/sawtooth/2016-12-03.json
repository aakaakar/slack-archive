The SGX PoET implementation requires an SGX enclave but there is a simulator (PoET simulator) which we use when testing (for example, on networks on AWS).  The simulator isn't appropriate for production though, as the pieces it simulates are important to the security of the algorithm. Consensus is pluggable but most of the effort to date has been around PoET and the PoET simulator.",
