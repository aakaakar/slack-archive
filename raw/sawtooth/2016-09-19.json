I understand you can  grab the contents of a specific transaction ID (found this on the wiki <https:\/\/gyazo.com\/263215ad09146aba6763fc784f92d718> ) but not sure how to grab contents of transactions that are of a specific type. If anyone could help that would be awesome, cheers :slightly_smiling_face:",
