When verify signature is called it checks the expected public_key against the the originator_public_key that is generated from the serialized object and the signature. If they differ, the signed_object (transaction) has been modified and is not valid. This fixes all transaction families since SignedObject is the superclass to all transactions.    Thanks again for pointing out this issue.",
