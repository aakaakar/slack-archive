For the cost savings, many things we want to highlight for example: realtime tracking, easy to find the problem components in defective product and easy to callback, reduce the cost of credit investigation for financial institution and easy to set the credit rating for participants in supply chain. Of cause, the bc is not silver bullet, it can not resolve everything, there are many apps and components off-chain we need develop. In our design, the bc is only used to record the transaction info and something can not be tampered, service for easy audit and tracking.",
