Can I get some pointers on where to start in Hyperledger with regards to contributing?\n\nI've spent the last 15 years at Amazon and Microsoft in technical program management, with a focus in devops.  Documentation, user stories, and developing code for systems integration are my happy spot.  \n\nThus far I've run example chaincodes against my local hyperledger+docker setup.  What I'd like to do is develop and document more examples or demos (with a focus on how to debug and run them at scale).  Would this be helpful or are there other areas that could use contribution first?\n\nThanks in advance.",
