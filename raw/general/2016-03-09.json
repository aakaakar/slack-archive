We have received temporary registration from CFTC for our Swap Execution Facility, and have a clearinghouse application in with CFTC as well - if approved, this basically means LedgerX would be a fully-licensed\/regulated blockchain clearinghouse. We feel this can help resolve many questions around compliance for blockchain projects. I'll be lurking to figure out how the Hyperledger Project works and I'm excited to be a part of this. Nice to meet everyone! \n\nAlso, thanks to whoever has been doing meeting minutes - those have been very helpful.",
