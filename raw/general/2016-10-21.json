At this point, you are enrolled (so you can't enroll again) but your credentials are local to the SDK and now you can only use the SDK to invoke\/query as the enrollID you used to enroll\n- The REST API works differently.

So in this case, the credentials end up being stored on the peer itself (by default in the `\/var\/hyperledge\/production\/client` directory and in your case this would be inside the Docker container)",
