Assuming you do the table creation in the \"init()\" method of chaincode, then when the chaincode is deployed to all the nodes the tables will be created.  If you chose to create the tables at first use the same would hold true.  Chaincode execution is what \"creates\" the tables\n\n2) Yes - RocksDB persists world state.  Tables are just a layer created on top of the standard K\/V structure of RocksDB\n\n3) Blocks contain transactions and transactions are basically the \"instructions\" which tell the peer which chaincode \/ function to execute using the parameters passed in the invoke.   A \"block\" is created after the execution of the transaction(s) (number of transactions per block is configurable) and each block contains  a hash of the world state after all of its contained transactions have executed\n\n4) I think 3) above answers this as well",
