What I am asking is, is this business of just using the nodes on the contract, and ALL those nodes (everyone has to agree) practice or theory right now with hyperledger ? I have a working solution, but f I can find a standard platform that does this then I dont have to implement my own blockchain from the bottom up, which is in effect what I am doing right now.  Proof of work as mentioned above is another one as we appear to be in the hands of the application programmers in the fintech world not to leather the system to death and behave in a socially acceptable manner. My experience of the insurance biz  so far doesnt bode well on that front, but if we can restrict the traffic so you only screw your own business partners' systems then it could work.",
