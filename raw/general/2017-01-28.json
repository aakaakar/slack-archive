On the contrary:\n\nWhile there is so much going on in the blockchain space these days - most of the prominent figures on these channels are well aware of these. We don\u2019t (really) live under a rock :wink:\n\nAt the same time - we are *really making an extra effort to not get involved in\/with these flaming wars* and neither try not to side with parties nor pick and choose the correct \u201ccamp\u201d - while I can speak (\/write?) only for myself, I have seen this consistently with many others members around me, regardless of employer, association or \u201cbitcoin\/blockchain\u201d camp.\n\nNoting that more than just that we do not have a \u201ccrypto-coin\/crypto-currency\u201d, more importantly, we all (or the vast majority of those involved or even part of it as observers, at least as far as I can see\/tell) are trying to keep this fertile ground for collaboration, that is also friendly and yes - *a nice place where our time is well spent*. We share ideas, discuss or even argue (technically) about directions, possibilities, technical decisions and plans. BUT, again, we really try to avoid the exact items that you have been posting here.\n\nWhile I would not call these posts \u201coutright\u201d spam - I do not believe that they belong here, nor do I feel that they really contribute to the \u201cgoal\u201d of this project\/effort. So in the context of Open Letters, I\/many of us would appreciate it if you don\u2019t post such things here - especially not in the <#C0J02NU1E|general> channel. If you really feel that you \u201cneed to post\/vent\u201d :wink:, at best, I would suggest the <#C0HVD269Z|random> channel, or so. I, personally, do check it out, randomly :wink:.\n\nFinally (and also because most of your posts are about \u201cbad people\u201d, etc\u2026), please appreciate that instead of blocking you, you getting another user, etc. - my simple request to you is:  *Please help us keep Hyperledger Project\u2019s Slack - open, friendly and productive*.\n\nI really hope you would appreciate where this is coming from &amp; and that you enjoy the rest of the weekend\u2026\n\nAmiably,\n\u2014 Jonathan\n\n------------------------------------------------------------",
