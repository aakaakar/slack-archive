I would love to see the chaincode called from a contract built with CommonAccord. There are tons of agreements already for seed or series A funding, and many others actually, and you could imagine enforcing the transactions (including for example the right of first refusal of one of the investor wants out) using chaincode. You can check this example here <http:\/\/www.commonaccord.org\/index.php?action=doc&amp;file=bq\/fr\/bnpp\/a5we\/0.md> it includes series A document, plus refers to the initial funding. All investors are defined as objects, and you can have all the other docs related to the formation of the corp. Also note this example of how chaincode could be called from a doc is here: <http:\/\/www.commonaccord.org\/index.php?action=doc&amp;file=.\/S\/Sandbox\/Blockchain\/TransactionTypeQw3rty02.md>",
