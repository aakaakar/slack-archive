Essentially such a network can only work based on the assumption that m (number of rogue nodes tolerated by PBFT) is large enough to make it impossible for that many parties to collude. would we then come to the logical conclusion that PBFT would not be suitable for a network with less than 10 nodes (assuming it\u2019s relatively easy for 2 parties to agree on an evil plot but difficult to get 3 or more to do that), with each node owned by a truly independent entity?",

So if you want to tolerate 2 faulty nodes, then you need (3*2) + 1 = 7 nodes.  But in general, the tone of the question is correct - when designing a PBFT network you need to take into account the number of faulty nodes you expect \/ can tolerate.  If you had 4 peers, you can tolerate 1 faulty peer so if 2 colluded, the network would halt but the integrity of the data would be intact",
