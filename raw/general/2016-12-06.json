We don't use permissioned or permissionless as it's overused term, it is a identified network given the legal prose.  We need to know who is communicating on network.  What we have implemented is the network map, which is a service .  The network map is simple service- it's a lookup service and it comes back the organization and their addressable network.  Certainly more to it than that,,.. signatures and chain certificates.  How do you get into that?  You need an enrollment service- I suspect what you have in membership services.  The requirements have is that we have workflow- here's who I am and proof of who I am and evidence that is necessary and there has to be a certiifcate authoritywhere humans validate this.

The end vision there is to specify the functional requirements-- define identity services, define smart contracts, define policy and crypto and storage layer.  We've been specifying the interfaces to them instead of implementation details.. that way you have options within those layers  ;.... Gari: take a simple example of Ethereum. Everyone takes that as the spec and go write that and build multiple version of ethereum. You can have multiple clients-- you deploy your code, but that is their mission and spec.  Who are we trying to help?  You can either be an umbrella that brings in projects, but when projects come in and ask community for help.  That's not scalable.. Unless you are growing community- you are just bringing in more things that compete with the same stuff.  the one trend that i've noticed is there are a lot  more people working on things and are now trying to use the products, but not contributers to product.  So we have people who brought original stuff-- but you battle for potential resources, we don't all get everything done and confuse people.  R3 originally had a great mission- it was a clear statement- we are here how blockchain is applicable and provide recommendations.  if that's the point of hyperledger project or key things everyone needs to have.. then that's fine, but that's different then here are projects how implemented, here's our resource pool, it's never going to work- we will have same 5 people... and someone is going to be upset with one project and go work on another. Who is this for?  *richard R3*  We have 5 different code bases.  The actual enemy - everyone is committed.  This has to be developed in open- as this has to be sticky-",

What richard is pointing out- it comes out in the open. different transport protocols- some of them will be good fit and some will be better at others.  We are still at experimental phase and diverse set of requirements and we are in early stages of the game. We have a set of buildling blocks that will be sanitized over time..
