I am attending OSCON in Austin this May, and I would like to extend an invitation to anybody who will be in Austin on 18th May to come along to a one-off Meetup which I have been arranging to bring together blockchain and DLT developers of all stripes to talk about all the cool stuff we are building!     I have already been in contact with Nitin Gaur, of the IBM Blockchain lab there in Austin, and his colleagues.     Factom are hosting, and we should have people from at least Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger.    I'm trying to get an invite out to the R3 Consortium too.     Please do spread this invite to any friends or colleagues who you think may be the interested!\n\n<https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/open-source-blockchain-meetup-austin-tx-may-18th-2016-bob-summerwill>",
