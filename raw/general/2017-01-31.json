I have seen people up here have a lot of different use case across many industries though, and there is lot of insight coming to the Hackfests by Hyperledger where you see what is being worked on (there is one in San Fran tomorrow and Thursday)  Some popular use case I've heard are  financial industry (things like cross border remittance and other parts of trade finance), digital property management\/provenance, supply chain, and so many others.",
