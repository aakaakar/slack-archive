        "text": "I am currently working on a practical use for Hyperledger Fabric where the blockchain would become a single instance of knowledge about assets which would be used for a more effective analysis by external analytical mechanisms. I will make three major assumptions about the data and the process related to this use for clarity:\n\n(1) The Fabric network would be capable of sending and receiving data from\/to outside world through API and chaincode. \n\n(2) Data source from which some date would interact with blockchain would be provided in a standardized format with exactly the same kind of information residing in fixed locations across databases. \n\n(3) Whatever changes happen in account A, they will also be reflected by changes in account B, although both accounts may not necessarily be aware of each other. Within the blockchain network, they would be two completely separate entities with separate tCerts issued to change their state. An example would be a simple accounting excercise where payment of 50USD from A to B would mean that A would incur a change of -50USD in their books, whereas B would incur a change of +50USD in their books.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the subject-matter of my problem described below:\n\nOne of crucial aspects related to the solution is the kind of information and its format that can be reasonably retained within the blockchain without impacting its performance, scalability and security. I am currently analyzing different approaches to data processing by taking into account Fabric's main features, such as Consensus, Provenance, Finality and Immutability. However, I want to make sure that I do not step on a landmine I would not be able to defuse once it's too late.\n\nTherefore, I am taking an assumption that:\n\n(a) the Blockchain should not be considered as an equivalent to a database. It can rather be compared to the ledger \n(b) Therefore, it should not be used for amounts and types of data typical to relational databases (RDBMS), unstructured databases (NOSQL\/Hadoop) or data warehouses. \n\nThis means that real data should be kept (conserved) in a structured format on an external (central) database. Here, blockchain's role could possibly be used as:\n- a hash list proving existence of an immutable piece of data\n- an archive for some particular entries extracted from a external database(s) used for reconciliation of conflicting information between various data sources\n- a ledger grouping some variables extracted from central database(s) under a single (unique) account with a possibility of tracing changes horizontally (cross-comparison with other accounts) and vertically (changes across time within a single account). Vertical tracing (changes within a single account) would be possible through a clustered analysis of tCerts provided by the CA to sign new transactions\n\nCan someone please confirm, correct, append or deny abovementioned assumptions?\n\np.s. Although there is a possibility to perform vertical tracing with tCerts, I find no possibility to have clustered analysis made horizontally (i.e. across accounts). Here I need to assume that external analytical tools would have to be used to take all tCerts and compare their changes one against another.",
