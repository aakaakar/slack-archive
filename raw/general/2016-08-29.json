Deploy chaincode, all 4 VPs create a new image and run create a new chaincode attaches to itself.\n3. Pump transactions, all 4 VPs update its chain.\n4. Join a new node as vp5, all existing 4 VPs know the newly join node, discovery list got updated, all 5 VPs connection seemed to be fine.\n\n**Problem**\nAll new transactions, will not affect to the vp5, but only old 4VPs. Means, I can also send transaction to vp5, but it will pass all the transaction to the rest 4 VPs.",
