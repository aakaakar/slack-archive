It's possible that the documentation you are looking at is in a section where it assumes you use vagrant to provision, which will put that *build\/bin* directory in your path.   If you are using another method, e.g. docker images or building native, you may get past this by updating your PATH accordingly or invoking it out of there.....   okay, on the post you just made....   the build\/bin directory will not be built until you run *make peer* or *make membersrvc*  (or any other make target that has a pre-req target for peer or membersrvc)",
