The motivation behind it was because of the new EU regulation General Data Protection Regulation for 25th may 2018. In the regulation, Organisations outside the EU are subject to this regulation when they collect data concerning any EU citizen.\nGDPR is designed to give individuals better control over their personal data held by organisations. Personal data is defined as any information relating to a person who can be identified directly or indirectly. This includes online identifiers, such as IP addresses and cookies, if they are capable of being linked back to the data subject.\nIndirect information might include physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identities that can be linked back to a specific individual.\n\nA key part of the regulation requires consent to be given by the individual whose data is held. Consent means \u201cany freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of his or her wishes by which the data subject, either by statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to personal data relating to them being processed\u201d.\n\nMost of the factors the Blockchain can work well with, however, consumers have the right to access, rectify or erase the data and the right to withdraw consent at any time.\n\nIs there a way to tackle the erasure of data at all?",

Here are the details.\n\nI am following this tutorial : <http:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/v0.6\/starter\/fabric-starter-kit\/>\nwhat happens after i run \"node app\"?\n\nI also looked at this tutorial : \n<http:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/v0.6\/Setup\/Chaincode-setup\/>\n\nEven though i was able to do all POST and GET requests, this documentation does not provide a good overview of what exactly is happening?\n\nHere are my questions :\n1) What is the difference between ethereum and fabric? I have worked on ethereum a bit and i would like to know what does fabric have that ethereum doesnt?\n\n2) How can i build a DAPP on fabric?\n\n3) How do i mine using fabric? are there any commands that i can run in terminal?",

The problem is, that *master* is now v1.0 code.    So, they are running Docker images with v0.6 code but when they build the chaincode locally, it incorporates v1.0 code in into it.   The solution is, in the *wget* and the *git clone*,  change *master* to *v0.6* in the path name.   I am being purposely vague as to where this documentation is, because if I've guessed correctly, you know what I'm referring to, but if I've guessed wrong, it's something else and I don't want to lead you on a wild goose chase.   I hope this helps.",
