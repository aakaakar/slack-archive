(take time to process the invoke longer than timeout)\n\nHowever, I'm thinking it might be better\/more appropriate to have access to this consensus state through the API\/SDK way, so then we can easily throttling the transaction invocation speed.\n\nBut still don't know how\/is it available here?",
