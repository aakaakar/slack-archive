It does nothing (if your nike selling lace up shoes) to prevent you from being disrupted by Marty McFly self tying shoes :slightly_smiling_face:.   In my experience, countering disruption within a corporation's franchise market requires a very different way of corporate thinking and strategic planning--- has everything to do with corporate culture, and little to do with the tech that used.    Different topic entirely.   The question for this community is how do you make this HL stuff easy to use for the devs that are newbies.   Think about the early days of amazon web services- a dev could with a few mouse clicks have their own server to play with.   No corporate IT process.   Heck, maybe not even anything to do with their day job at all.    From what i'm seeing, that's the central challenge for the HL community.",
