I am a French developer who recently left his job to create a startup around B2B blockchain applications. I have been following the blockchain's ecosystem for some time now and I strongly believe the Hyperledger's specifications makes it perfectly suited for B2B applications. I started working around some business cases on the Hyperledger protocol. I want to simulate a full bockchain network, ie several companies working on an unique blockchain with different access rules (as described in the 4th protocol-spec paragraphe). However as mentionned in the 4,7th paragraphe some restrinctions in the current release don't allow it. Is there roadmap for the implementation of the fully operational membership service\u00a0? Thanks for your answers.",
