If, for instance, I was an entity A with my own HLF block chain and wanted to handle an asset from entity B who had their own HLF block chain, how would I assemble this transaction and be able to validate it on my own A chain?  Maybe is there be a way to delegate peers between chains to ensure that if the other B network goes down I can still check that all the transactions on the other ledger are kosher?  In other words how do I link a bunch of sub-chains and ensure any transactions between them are valid?",
