This was fixed recently, and so is the only way you can store a timestamp and have it pass consensus. A real advantage of this technique is that your internal state changes, if timestamped, will perfectly align with the transaction time on the blockchain itself. That, in my opinion, is an excellent audit feature (my contracts retain the event history in world state.)",
