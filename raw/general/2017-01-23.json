Hyperledger decided to use well tested, proven scheme for efficient binary encoding, that has ports in every proper language - Protocol buffers. About the nodes there is no difference in which node you are connecting. Hyperledger will take care for all communication between nodes and there roles. Of course,  you have to connect to node that has proper role for executing \"commands\". So, you expose one or many nodes to public access, you can assign DNS A record to node IP address if you want, and connect using this domain\/IP address. And for sure you can create some \"internal\" network so that only IoT devices can connect to this node\/nodes.\nThink like this - if you are able to make socket connection to your server then you can run Hyperledger there and connect to it using protocol buffers.
