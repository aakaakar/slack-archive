I am currently running through the page (Setting Up a Network For Development: <https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/blob\/master\/docs\/dev-setup\/devnet-setup.md>). My understanding is that the IP address 172.17.0.1 is assigned to an host on a CLASS B Network. And a class B network is reserved for use by private networks that are not connected to the internet. I am willing to open a port to my computer from my router (connected to the internet) and do port forwarding. Please advise. Thanks.",
