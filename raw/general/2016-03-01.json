I just believe that unifying around a specification as well will help other implementations have a bona fide checklist of compliance so that we can have a one worldwide platform from many implementations.\n\nAs for the reinvention, it was still to drive the standard specification, but being that the arguments for a production-level implementation is very sound because we have great experts, I'm fine with that approach too (having expressed my point :))\n\nIn brief I look forward participating however the community goes code-wise. I also hope you'll consider owning a standard specification as well.\n\nTo digress a bit, perhaps there might be regulations or other controls in some key economy elsewhere in the world which may make the production-level subject to modification or rewrite to be viable there (cryptographic export\/import regulations, anonymity, trade policies, \"censorship\", etc) that's one of the reasons owning the standard could possibly keep the initiative under the same wing)...\n\nThanks for your feedback. I hope there's still more to add :)",
