The mailing lists are designed for this, are real-time, and afford participation by those who can't all be at the same place at the same time.  I appreciate the urgency to address and close outstanding PRs, that's great, but it shouldn't have to wait for a particular hour of the week.",

On Apache in the early days we tended to use \"three +1's, and no vetos\", meaning so long as you could point to support from three other people (ideally not co-workers but we can roll with that for now) and no other developer stepping up to object to the change, then you could proceed to commit the change.
