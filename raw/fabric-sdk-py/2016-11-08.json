Instead, running `tox` with CPython 2.7 and 3.4 installed, but not 3.3, gives: ``` ERROR: InterpreterNotFound: python3.3 ERROR: unknown environment 'py27' ``` Different combinations of missing interpreters can give different InterpreterNotFound and unknown environment errors, and it's not deterministic which will be reported. Commenting out the `commands = ` line causes it to run with: ``` py27: commands succeeded SKIPPED: py33: InterpreterNotFound: python3.3 py34: commands succeeded congratulations :) ``` As I'd expect, but of course this then doesn't run the tests. `tox -e` using py27 or py34 will run, `tox -e py33` gives the same error as `tox`. This is on Ubuntu Linux. I've tried both version 1.8.0, the version packaged by Ubuntu, and version 2.1.1 installed with pip, and they exhibit the same behavior.",
