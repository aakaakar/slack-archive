        "text": "<@U0KN2SSKE>  , why would you want CoP to generate TLS cert ? From cryptographic perpsective , any cert , ECERT or TCERT can be used for TLS encryption. Usually , ppl use either self signed tls cert for dev purposes and enterprise TLS cert in prod(which I think customers will already possess). TLS Cert and ECert are differentiated from context in which they are being used and management aspect. I do not think , returning 2 certs : ECERT and TCert as part of enrollment process is good option.",

Is that correct, and how does one obtain PreK0?  (From an ECert, a TCert, or where?)  Also, is there any more detailed documentation on the pre-key tree as mentioned in the document on Attributes?  Thanks",
