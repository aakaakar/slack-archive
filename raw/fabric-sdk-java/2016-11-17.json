Is there a way to get into Java chaincode development without using vagrant? Also, second question, I see that the example references $GOHOME when talking about gradle. Do I need to install and use GO language to deal with Java chaincode programming? Thanks for any directions. I can't find any tutorial or doc specific for Java as I see all examples are related to Go. Thanks.",
