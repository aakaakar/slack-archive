The README.md has instructions on how to run it but it's a little out of date in setting up the server  side but I assume anyone actively here knows how to do that.  I just ran it ok with  End2endIT with Jan 13th server side.  The README.MD has the latest commit revision.  As you know things are moving target have not tried with a server side newer than that.\n\nThe goal here was to follow the sdk spec and hide any of the proto code from the user.   \n\nI never did anymore clean up since there was no intent on using it. Feel free to cherry pick",
