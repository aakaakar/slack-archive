The fabric-sdk-java repo should be focused on v1.0 IMHO.  Although if you feel you want to tag the current stuff in there as v0.6 that's fine as well I suppose.  But bottom line is we should not be too focused on v0.6 for new work  (and <@U2Q0HP4HY> for you we want you to specially focus on v1.0)",
