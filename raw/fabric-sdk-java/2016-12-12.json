That failed because it won't match with the protobufs level in WIP_fabric_v1.   The WIP_fabric_v1 protobufs seem to be more current but code signing is not there.  Neither is COP code go get credentials needed now .   I did try this against a Fabric level 12\/9 too but that fails as I would expect since the proposal is neither signed not had the signed user certificate How did you get this work ?",
