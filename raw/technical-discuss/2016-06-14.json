We have a straw-man agenda here (<https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1ROq44KpxuelkOp8GpceFNcv8K6XfWdaOnknzBk73OMc\/edit>) that lists the various call-in details, some proposed topics, etc.  We expect participation from the Community in identifying interesting topics to work on and identifying leaders to drive forward various efforts.  Much like the other Hackathons, this will be run in unconference format.  Please feel free to add comments and suggestions to the Google doc referenced above.",
