While we have done everything in our power to ensure its accuracy, we ask you to take one final look before EOD tomorrow (August 10th).\nIf you are not on this list and should be, please reach out directly to me (if you can reference a specific pull request, that would be helpful).\nThere are about 10 people highlighted in blue at the bottom of the list (missing either a name or an email), if you have this information, please send me an email.\nIf your name is highlighted in yellow, we have multiple email addresses for you.  Please confirm with me your preferred email address to be used in conjunction with the election.\nWe will send a separate email on August 11th to call for nominations from those on the list referenced above, as well as detail out the entire nomination and election process.\n\nRegards,",
