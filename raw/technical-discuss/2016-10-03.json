You asked I have a question if there are restrictions on the size of table and the entries in the rows and columns. I'm planning to create a table of customers that requires them to put their  reports  that can be 1G  or more in size.  My response would be that 1G is very large. I don\u2019t think anything this size has been tested yet. My suggestion would be to get a hash of the report, and use the hash, while storing the report somewhere else. <@U11HTMW0H> <@U1KFCPFQA> would you agree?",
