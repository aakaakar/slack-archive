Of course, when you think about this going forward, there are some options to consider as to how developers consume fabric. In my fevered imagination, I envisage that developers will work in a typical containerized manner, pulling images to their laptop, running them and exec\u2019ing into them to develop. Hence this really could be considered an SDK container image - for node. Now, the challenge then becomes as we add more chaincode support, then you have combinatorial challenge. Node SDK + Go chaincode, Node + Java chaincode, Java SDK + Java chaincode, Java SDK + Solidity, etc etc etc",
