I plan to continue working, but I\u2019m not sure whether it will be related to Blockchain or not. As such, I\u2019ve decided to pass the leadership of the Requirements Working Group to someone else. <@U0KM61BCP> will be asking for volunteers at the F2F tomorrow. I will certainly work with  the next leader to make the transition as simple as possible.",
