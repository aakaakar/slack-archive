In this case, we are not getting the \"hash\" of chain code that we could use in \"invoke\" &amp; \"query\" methods.\n\nPlease let us know, if we need to make CHANGES in core.yaml or membersrvc.yaml to get \"HASH\" in the the response message from \"deploy\" method of hyperledger v 0.6.\n\nThanks",
