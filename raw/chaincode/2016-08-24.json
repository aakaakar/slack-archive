Parameter \"Function\" was moved to \"Args\" array. All parameters should be base64 encoded. So, tried with the following option\n\n```  peer chaincode deploy -n mycc -c {\"args\":['aW5pdA==', 'YQ==', 'MTAwMA==', 'Yg==', 'MjAwMA==']}\nError: Chaincode argument error: invalid character 'a' looking for beginning of object key string ```\n\nNot sure what I am doing wrong here...",
