I will experiment both single Go file option from github and multiple files with volumes.  The volumes option should work as others have done it successfully.\n\nNow, I need to also find out to to have the chaincode split into multiple packages\/files and get them deployed on Bluemix\n\nI will post my findings once I am done.",
