        "text": "Hi, Want to understand typically how rule evaluations are done in chaincode.  In typical enterprise systems the rules are maintained externally on rule engines. If the chaincode has to evaluate the rules then they can be invoked from chaincode.  However, this may introduce a non-deterministic behaviour. Any thoughts how the rule evaluations should be done? Thanks",
