        "text": "<!channel>: Hi, I cautiously use at-channel, and I wonder if the hyperledger project is losing focus.\nAt an IBM presentation yesterday, a good analogy was presented between the rails and the train.\nIt looks like the discussions here have been about trains instead of the rails.  For example, details such as UTXOs, chaincode, etc are at the train level, instead of the rails level.  They are helpful, but shouldn't the focus be on defining on the HLTP, then anyone can build trains that go on those rails.  (Right now the discussions look like how to jam everyone's trains together.)\n\nIf HLTP isn't clear, a starting point is given by the name itself: transport protocol.  (\"HLTP\" may be inaccurate itself, but a good reminder about the rails.)\nHere's an example:\n<https:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/wiki\/wiki\/libp2p-Whitepaper>\n<https:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/devp2p\/blob\/master\/rlpx.md>\n<https:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/wiki\/wiki\/%C3%90%CE%9EVp2p-Wire-Protocol>\n\nIs the project focusing on HLTP?  If not, why isn't it focusing on the rails?",
