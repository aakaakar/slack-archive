        "text": "<@U0ZJZBJLF> To continue the thought from the earlier hangout, I would propose that:\n\n1. A non-byzantine peer which connects to the orderer _must_ validate the block received from ordering before gossiping about it.\n2. In order to validate a block, that peer must have all previous blocks committed, and therefore knows the index of the last configuration block.\n3. When the peer gossips about the block, it can also include the index of the last configuration block\n4. Any peer which receives a block who's last configuration block index is not committed must not gossip about that block until that index is committed\n\nAs I see it, the attacks are:\n1. A byzantine peer lies and claims a configuration change has not recently taken place.  This to me is a non-attack, as the result is the block being gossiped to an older set of authorized peers.  Because this is only information leakage, the byzantine peer could do this without the network's assistance.\n2. A byzantine peer lies and claims a configuration change has taken place when one has not, this could cause peers to buffer blocks which are invalid, because they cannot currently validate the block (because they do not have the corresponding config block).  This seems like a problem which must be addressed regardless of what information is in the block.  Even if the full configuration is embedded in the block header, if that configuration is different, there is no way to validate it until all preceeding blocks have been committed.",
