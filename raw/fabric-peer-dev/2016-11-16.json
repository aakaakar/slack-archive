        "text": "The way we thought about it in the context of gossip:\n1. Gossip selects internally a leader peer for every organization (Member) - equivalent to an anchor peer\n\n2. The leader connects to the ordering service on behalf of the organization\n\n3. JoinChannel is invoked on a peer - the information is propagated within the organization peers, and in particular reaches the organization leader which invokes Deliver() on the ordering service\n\n4. Blocks flow from the ordering service through the leader and are gossiped to all registered peers in the organization\n\n5. Information on peer inclusion in a channel is gossiped with all other peers in the designated organizations\n\n6. State transfer \/ synchronization within a channel can take place across organizations belonging to the same channel\n\n7. Upon a leader failure a new one is selected within the organization and connects to the ordering service on behalf of all registered channels\n\nMore detailed information can be found in the gossip design document: <https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/157AvKxVRqgeaCTSpN86ICa5x-XihZ67bOrNMc5xLvEU\/edit#heading=h.rrii36vrca54>",

Will configuration application send new join channel request to all peers who already in channel, to let them know about new peer? And if peer went down forever - should new request be send as well?  \nAnd regarding Approach 1.d - why peers should contact anchor peer at all?",
