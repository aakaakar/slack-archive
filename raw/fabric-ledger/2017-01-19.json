I suspect the former, but please clarify.  And indeed if it is the former, in v1.0 the design is for the state database to be pluggable.  In fact, an implementation has already been coded to use CouchDB as an alternative to the v1.0 default of goLevelDB.  \nYou may want to re-ask your question (please try to clarify to address my initial question here if what I asked makes any sense) in <#C2GFRAE7P|fabric-ledger-dev> as I think you're more likely to get the attention of the developers who created the CouchDB implementation.   (Not sure if the implementation of CouchDB is complete or still in the works, but I think the developers in <#C2GFRAE7P|fabric-ledger-dev> will know).",
