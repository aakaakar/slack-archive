In other words you don't create cli or SDK... you look at config- they need channel test id to start up and then we create it. rather than we have it in the code.  This assumes that we have ability in orderer and predefine in channel and genesis block and use with the peer.  We have to have block from orderer.  The orderer has to start the config block and they need to know members.. We just need to have a default thing that people start with.  This whole process is security based.. we haven't configured the orderers MSPs properly. . In our code we automatically create test channel-- that is the point. If that needs to go, we need to startup with channel for programming. We need to come up with dev mode kind of thing..  Easy to say create channel in peer, but I also need channel in orderer.  This is where the complication is.  The current feature will bootstrap system in 4 seconds. having a test id channel- the user test - i would just get rid of everything and it confuses everything.  We need to come up with a way- a nice simple way in the bootstrapping feature scenario how we have a system come up for people that is working,.. and we can do that.",
