Totally understand that you posted to the issues which is the right thing to do and I can understand if you wanted to say that we were being unresponsive.    But if you have taken a step back, perhaps you could have come up with some constructive comments and improvements for both the BMX Blockchain service as well as the fabric.",

I'm posting it here for any developers that are or were using IBM Blockchain on BMX for focusing on chaincode development:  BMX IBM Blockchain is BROKE for developers who want to deploy their own or demo code from github as IBM documentation describes.\n\nThe Demo Chaincode Example02 works only from the UI. You cannot deploy it from github. The UI is confusing, because the link to the source code being deployed goes to v0.6 code (shim.ChaincodeStubInterface).\n\nIf you copy the source code to your own github repo and try to deploy it you get an error complaining about the shim.ChaincodeStubInterface (v0.6 code).\n\nIf you change the code to v0.5 (shim.ChaincodeStub), it indicates a successful deploy, returning a chaincode ID. But upon examination of the network tab it is clear it did not deploy correctly, it never appears and cannot be found as indicated by a query that returns an error message hinting this.\n\nSo, clearly something is BROKE in IBM Blockchain on BMX.\n\nAgain, you can only deploy and operate the Demo Chaincode. You cannot deploy your own code from github, even though it is a perfect copy of the chaincode IBM indicates is being deployed.\n\nAnother point of confusion is the code level deployed and supported on IBM Blockchain.\n\nIs it Fabric v0.5 (shim.ChaincodeStub) or Fabric v0.6 (shim.ChaincodeStubInterface)?\n\nBecause only code compiled to v0.5 (shim.ChaincodeStub) is consumed without an error indication while code compiled to v0.6 is consumed, but returns an ERROR indicating it does not like the v0.6 code (shim.ChaincodeStubInterface).\n\nI highly suggest IBM NOT rely on canned tests baked into the UI--Demo Chaincode. Instead rely on what a developer does: compile chaincode, push it to your github repo, and deploy it using the URL to your github repo.\n\nThe inability of developers to deploy their own code makes BMX IBM Blockchain at this time USELESS to developers and only a very simple sales demo!",

        "text": "the current struggle we have with the BMX service is that fact that the interface in master \/ v0.6 changed from what it was in the 0.5 release.   We had no way of anticipating this and did not originally want to be stuck \"vending\" the entire fabric with all of the samples.   Further, the v0.5 branch was removed from public access as well - making things even harder.    And a few facts:\n\n1) You can deploy your own chaincode to BMX - you simply need to implement the v0.5 shim interface.  You don't even need to vendor the fabric to do this because we actually have the fabric in our GOPATH when we compile and deploy the chaincode within BMX.   Yes - I realize this makes it impossible to compile locally and we'll fix that by documenting what to do\n\n2) We have a fairly complex setup network wise for BMX and unfortunately some of our internal routing got messed up and resulted in fairly massive delays in deploying chaincode on some of our backend nodes.  We are working to fix that\n\nI guess my real point is that rather than criticizing, perhaps asking questions about why we did what we did, what the cause of the errors is \/ was and constructive help in terms of versioning, etc would have been a better approach.    Go has no real concept of versions unless you do it artificially.  You can find dialog about versioning for fabric interface moving forward in other channels.\n\nOh - and incidentally - for the record I actually do agree with you that we should not embed deployment of the samples in the dashboard.  The idea was OK - make it easy for someone who just wants to check things out to get something running, but its problematic in that it does not force us to work on the overall consumability of developing and deploying chaincode",

FYI, deploying from github still is not working. Response says Ok and returns an ID but the ID never shows up in the Network tab and queries return not found error.
