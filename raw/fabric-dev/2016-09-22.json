I'm posting it here for any developers that are or were using IBM Blockchain on BMX for focusing on chaincode development:  BMX IBM Blockchain is BROKE for developers who want to deploy their own or demo code from github as IBM documentation describes.\n\nThe Demo Chaincode Example02 works only from the UI. You cannot deploy it from github. The UI is confusing, because the link to the source code being deployed goes to v0.6 code (shim.ChaincodeStubInterface).\n\nIf you copy the source code to your own github repo and try to deploy it you get an error complaining about the shim.ChaincodeStubInterface (v0.6 code).\n\nIf you change the code to v0.5 (shim.ChaincodeStub), it indicates a successful deploy, returning a chaincode ID. But upon examination of the network tab it is clear it did not deploy correctly, it never appears and cannot be found as indicated by a query that returns an error message hinting this.\n\nSo, clearly something is BROKE in IBM Blockchain on BMX.\n\nAgain, you can only deploy and operate the Demo Chaincode. You cannot deploy your own code from github, even though it is a perfect copy of the chaincode IBM indicates is being deployed.\n\nAnother point of confusion is the code level deployed and supported on IBM Blockchain.\n\nIs it Fabric v0.5 (shim.ChaincodeStub) or Fabric v0.6 (shim.ChaincodeStubInterface)?\n\nBecause only code compiled to v0.5 (shim.ChaincodeStub) is consumed without an error indication while code compiled to v0.6 is consumed, but returns an ERROR indicating it does not like the v0.6 code (shim.ChaincodeStubInterface).\n\nI highly suggest IBM NOT rely on canned tests baked into the UI--Demo Chaincode. Instead rely on what a developer does: compile chaincode, push it to your github repo, and deploy it using the URL to your github repo.\n\nThe inability of developers to deploy their own code makes BMX IBM Blockchain at this time USELESS to developers and only a very simple sales demo!",

I can see my init message arg passed in JSON, but the id does not display in the Network tab, unlike the demo which does. So the Network tab shows no chaincode id, and the Blockchain tab shows 2 blocks, genesis and the deploy. Clicking the deploy block shows the time, chaincode id, and the arg I passed in for the init. Now if I try to query it an error is returned as described above. Others are getting the same error and experiencing the same behavior. There is obviously a disconnect as evidenced by UI observation. Here is the error for easy reference:  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32003,\n    \"message\": \"Query failure\",\n    \"data\": \"Error when querying chaincode: Error:Failed to launch chaincode spec(Error starting container: API error (500): Error: image library\/976f2c99-b4d5-47f1-8625-050cc3567aca-vp1-f1846c248dcfa64fbfe7176a85b2fdfaeb3f4bc742d68666ab0715f61d3c10f0fea5bb3611235f1697a71e10d8667d3f46cd99cacf42f3ba7084add1a63f8fc4 not found\\n)\"\n  },...looks like code (image) is not where it should be...but we know it's out there somewhere or not, maybe the Blockchain tab is only displaying result but not proof.",
