There are tons of use cases for this. One way to solve this is to have external data pushed down to the blockchain (once it changes, periodically or whatsoever). But in cases when this is not possible the chaincode should be able to reach out for data. For Ethereum Smart Contracts they introduced the concept of Oracles, and Microsoft provides the Cryplet architecture to deal with this having supprot from Intel via enclaves. There must be some pattern \/ guideline how to deal with this in case of Hyperledger allowing chaincode to reach out for external data. I do understand the problem that this has to be consistent over all Peers and should result with collecting the same data.",
