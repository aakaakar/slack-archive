In 0.5 if a transaction is sent (invoke) to the blockchain and it results in an error we can see this by watching the events and in the block event under non hash data each transaction is listed and if it resulted in error there is an error object in it with the error.\nIn 0.6 if a transaction results in an error there is no record for it in the non hash data. Is this a bug, or intentional? If intentional how is a client now supposed to be able to see if a transaction it has submitted has resulted in an error?",
