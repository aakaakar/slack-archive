I mean if I deploy using NodeSDK to remote peer - what dependencies should be installed on this host: my chaincode, go dependencies, peer images - and why?",

The default Dockerfile created by the SDKs (currently) requires that you include the source for your chaincode as well as any external dependencies (which also includes the fabric src) packaged in the vendor folder of your chaincode directory in order to deploy",

It make sense - but what we phased yesterday (based on v06) deploying from remote NodeSDK to the peer is that it caused chaincode start error on peer before we have not pulled docker images on NodeSDK, which was a bit odd.. is it expected to pull docker images on NodeSDK to deploy chaincode or did we mixed something?",
