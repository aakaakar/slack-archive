Many are at the Hackfest here in SF, but for those who are not, we'll have to be adapting our workflow to using Gerrit.\n\nThe rationale for transitioning to Gerrit is to a) provide much more governance over the IP hygiene by enforcing the DCO sign-off on every commit merged (no exceptions). We did not have this level of rigor on GitHub. b) to enforce that no maintainer can merge their own commits. c) to enforce a rule that requires multiple reviewers to agree to a merge.\n\nThis may slow things down initially until we all get the swing of the new flow, but it will give us higher quality code and much better IP assurances.\n\nThe Gerrit repo will be here: <https:\/\/gerrit.hyperledger.org\/r\/#\/admin\/projects\/fabric>\nCurrently, the code is in the process of being migrated over. There's an active review here <https:\/\/gerrit.hyperledger.org\/r\/#\/c\/255\/> for the initial commit of code to Gerrit. Once that is merged by the maintainers, everyone will need to clone that repo for their development going forward, and do git pushes to Gerrit. Basically, I have copied the GH code into a pristine git repository at the behest of LF so that we can benefit from the IP hygiene hooks in Gerrit that assure that every commit carries a DCO sign-off.\n\nTo submit code for review, you will need a Linux Foundation ID here: <https:\/\/identity.linuxfoundation.org\/> . Simple enough,if you have an ID, you are set. If not, please create one. This will grant you SSO across the LF tools portfolio.\nAdd your SSH key to Gerrit\n1. click on your profile (upper right hand corner) and select 'Settings' and then 'SSH Public Keys'\n2. from a terminal window: pbcopy &lt; ~\/.ssh\/id_rsa.pub \n3. paste into the Gerrit window for your SSH key\n4. press 'Add' button\n\nSo, the new workflow would be as follows:\n\n1. Clone the Gerrit repository. \n1.a from the Projects menu in Gerrit, click 'list' in the LF corner.\n1.b from the list of projects, select 'fabric'\n(note, you will want to PRESERVE your previous Fabric repository clone because you may want to be able to push any outstanding PRs to Gerrit by copying the source from your GH clone to the Gerrit clone).\n1.c from the project window, select 'Clone with commit hook' and then copy the command and paste to a terminal window to clone the repository into your $GOPATH\/src\/github.com\/hyperledger folder. \n2. make your changes\n3. commit your code\n4. git push origin HEAD:refs\/for\/master \n\nThe GH fabric repo will remain in read-only mode until we establish the mirror from Gerrit. We will preserve the current state of the hyperledger\/fabric repo (and all subsequent transitioned repositories) for posterity at a location TBD (likely something like 'hyperledger-archive' org on GH).",
