Image created by \u201cmake docker\u201d seems to assume COP_HOME is \u201c\/etc\/hyperledger\/cop\u201d while the sample assumes to have \u201c~\/.cop\u201d for certificate and keys, and \u201c\/config\u201d for cop.json configuration file.  I think we should use \u201cmake docker\u201d one, because it seems light weight (only consumes 50MB, and comes with busybox only, i.e. more secure).",
