        "text": "<@U0S5KF44D> - sorry - I realized that I was not actually very clear in what I was trying to say.   What I should have said is that:\n\n1) either we require that you always pass in `-config`  (but I can see why you might not want that)\n\n2) we document the default directory for the config and do \"honor\" an environment variable for signing it (if you want to override the default pass in the `-config` option.\n\nwe can argue \/ decide what the default location should be - my personal preference is that it be something relative to the executable:\n\n```\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"os\"\n    \"path\/filepath\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    dir, err := filepath.Abs(filepath.Dir(os.Args[0]))\n    if err != nil {\n            log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n    fmt.Println(dir)\n}\n\n```\n\nat least for the server.   for the client, I could be convinced that it's the $HOME directory",
