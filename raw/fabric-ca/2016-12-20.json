The fact that a \u201cuser\u201d has a OTP (one time password) entry in the memberservc.yaml\u2026 does not (yet) grant him\/her the permission to deploy\/execute a transaction...\n\nThe entry in the that yaml file, allows the user to register and enroll to the \u201csystem\u201d, in a process resulting with an ECert (Enrollment Cert) a TCert (Transaction Cert) that are required in order to transact.\n\nThat part of the question is also good for the \u201ccop\u201d channel. I will post it there too in case you need more\/relevant details about that part of the flow.",
