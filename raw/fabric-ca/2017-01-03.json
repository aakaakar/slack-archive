Both e-certs and t-certs can expire or be revoked.  If a t-cert is revoked, the e-cert can still be used to get other t-certs.  If an e-cert is revoked, it can no longer be used to get t-certs.  It would still be good to know exactly what the requirement is pertaining to a \"soft logout\".",

I would suggest stopping membersrvc and deleting the DB again, and also delete the local keyValStore on the java-SDK side.  This will force the SDK to re-enroll with membersrvc.  Let me know if this doesn't work and we can do some more diagnosing",
