I've issued a couple of pull requests to CFSSL to provide the extensibility hooks we've needed.  The 1st one was processed pretty quickly but the 2nd one, and even smaller change, is taking longer.  Changing the default port wasn't as easy as you'd think, but was able to do without changing CFSSL code, but not always possible.  Anyway, I raised the white flag and see everyone's point ... so we're at 7054 now, or will be once merged",
