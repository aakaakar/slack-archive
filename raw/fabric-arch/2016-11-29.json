Under section 4, Raw Ledger: \"TThe raw ledger contains information about both valid and invalid transactions and provides a verifiable history of all successful and unsuccessful state changes and attempts to change state, occurring during the operation of the system\"\n2. Under section 2.4: \"It is important to note that invalid transactions are not committed, do not change the state, and are not recorded.\". Does recorded mean recorded in the validated ledger.\n\nWhat would be the purpose of the storing invalid transactions in the raw ledger anyway, as invalid transactions do not modify the global state anyway?",
