The issue you are observing, related to the above error as well as to the locking errors, has been introduced within the past several days.

To fix this issue, this is where my change set comes in:\n\n<https:\/\/gerrit.hyperledger.org\/r\/#\/c\/949\/1>\n\nTo test, please execute `chmod -R 777 ~\/.npm\/` followed by removing the already installed modules with `rm -rf \/fabric\/sdk\/node\/node_modules`.
