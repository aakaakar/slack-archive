When you call the REST APIs to register \/ login users against a peer, the peer then basically acts as a client on your behalf (kind of like a wallet).  So the peer itself actually calls all of the membersvcs APIs under the covers and essentially downloads all of the enrollment material locally.  `enrollSecret` is basically a one time use token, so when you login to the first peer, that `enrollSecret` cannot be used again hence the failures and also the reason why you can use a different enrollID \/ enrollSecret against each peer and things work.   There is a new NodeJS SDK which is coming out which will use the \"native\" API and have wallet like functionality.  In that case, you'll be able to point the client at multiple peer using the same credentials.

If I post `invoke` approaches to multiple peers concurrently, according to the consensus protocol, the eventual state of each node should be consistent, right?  \nHowever, this is my test: I post stress `invoke` requests to `peer1` and `peer2`, then stop the requests.

But the docs do seem to be pretty accurate.\n\nI have had no trouble working with a single peer in dev mode and my chaincodes in dev mode as well. The deploy command is necessary to call your Init, and it should be the first message you send after starting up the chaincode, else it will be ignored. I find, though, that if your container's database has been initialized, you can restart at will and just carry on without the deploy. Everything works as expected. I have also implemented a \"clearWorldState\" function that I find incredibly handy so that I can start again with a deploy etc ...\n\nWorking with POSTMAN using REST works perfectly fine as well. For a fairly well featured IoT sample with related POSTMAN scripts and environments, take a look at the sdk folder linked below. There are docs to go with it. It is far from perfect, but it is an exploration of ways in which Hyperledger can be used for IoT contracts with a single tracked asset and multiple devices reporting on it. It tries to avoid API proliferation using a pattern I came up with called \"partial state as event\" ... I am working on the more advanced form with multiple related assets and multiple event functions, but that will not be ready for a few weeks as I am on vacation right now.\n\n<https:\/\/github.com\/ibm-watson-iot\/blockchain-samples\/tree\/master\/sdk>","attachments":[{"service_name":"GitHub","title":"ibm-watson-iot\/blockchain-samples","title_link":"https:\/\/github.com\/ibm-watson-iot\/blockchain-samples\/tree\/master\/sdk","text":"blockchain-samples - Samples demonstrating the use of Blockchain with IBM Watson IoT","fallback":"GitHub: ibm-watson-iot\/blockchain-samples","thumb_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/16575965?v=3&s=400","from_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/ibm-watson-iot\/blockchain-samples\/tree\/master\/sdk","thumb_width":263,"thumb_height":263,"service_icon":"https:\/\/github.com\/apple-touch-icon.png","id":1}],"ts":"1471621637.001424","reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["U1JB7QCBD"],"count":1}]},{"type":"message","user":"U0STZRN0Y","text":"<@U0ULK2JPP>: I was successful until the step where I register the chain code \"CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=mycc CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7051 .\/chaincode_example02\".

This is unnecessary and adds no value compared to starting a pre-built image.\n3) Adding chaincode support for new programming language(s) requires  changes to 'peer'.\n\nI suggest \"peer deploy\" command should use the published docker image and starts a container..

It is really when you start to combine things like Linux, bridge interfaces, overlay networks, Docker and Swarm that things get interesting.  Here's a few examples:\n\n1) The Linux kernel has a hard-coded limit of 1024 virtual interfaces per bridge interface.  This is of course sort-of known if you know Linux networking and you can work around it by creating multiple bridge interfaces.   But - now let's say you want to use Docker's built-in overlay network driver AND the containers needs to connect to external networks.  This results in a bridge network network being created automatically and overlay networks can only use this bridge network.  End result:   as far as we can tell, using the Docker overlay driver results in a limit of 1023 containers per host\n\n2) Docker Swarm calls RefreshNetwork as part of every CreateContainer call.  The larger the number of containers on the overlay network, the more expensive this call becomes and the longer it takes to start each container.  (FYI - looks like there is a fix for this in the current master branch for Swarm and we'll take a look at that)\n\n3) There are a number of other setting which we have learned about via trial and error as well:\n\n- parameters like `net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1`, `net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2`,`net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3` need to be set much higher than the defaults in order to avoid arp table overruns\n\n- parameters like `vm.dirty_ratio` and `vm.dirty_background_ratio` need to be properly set to lower values when you have a lot of containers which write to disk else Ubuntu will hang due to task timeouts\n\nThe reality is that there really is no documentation \/ documented best practices of trying to run things like Swarm at massive scale when you need things like overlay networks, have stageful containers, etc.","edited":{"user":"U0PB67X4K","ts":"1473115263.000000"},"ts":"1473114572.000033","reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["U0YR44350","U268EB76W","U1M7K67EV"],"count":3}]},{"type":"message","user":"U0PB67X4K","text":"And just in case you don't know what we do \/ try to do, one part of my job is to own the Bluemix Blockchain Service where we run  4 peer + CA PBFT networks for our customers.

For example, say the ledger is used by the chaincode to hold an orderbook, with offers constantly changing at high frequency. It is likely that clients will be submitting to different peers at around the same time transactions that will modify the tip of the orderbook. My reading of the design document is that this will frequently lead to the `STALE_VERSION` endorsement being returned. \nRipple\u2019s approach to this issue is to group a set of transactions into a batch which are processed in a hard to predict determinisitc order and loose time constraints dictate which transactions get into which batch.

implement similar usecase on fabric ), in auction use case the items are moving from one person to other person when we query its shows only the current worldstate of the chain so question is  1) if i want to see complete audit trail for an item how can i query in fabric 2) when a record get stored in block it will have hash for that block, so when show the complete audit trail for an item i believe i should show the records with corresponding block hash, is my understanding is correct? 3) is it possible to get complete audit trail for an item by query block chain any time or do i need to store transaction in external db's by getting hash from block chain when write transaction into blockchain 4) for same use case is it possible to store the image in block chain  ( consider my image size will be more than 20MB ) and get a hash for it and refer same hash in actual transaction\n\nAppreciate your response in advance :slightly_smiling_face:  your reply will really help me to

After few minutes of idle time, the connection is reset by peer and it crashes the nodejs app. Not sure where to catch this error to avoid my nodejs app crash.\n```\nevents.js:160\n      throw er; \/\/ Unhandled 'error' event\n      ^\n\nError: {\"created\":\"@1484874109.778586000\",\"description\":\"Secure read failed\",\"file\":\"..\/src\/core\/lib\/security\/transport\/secure_endpoint.c\",\"file_line\":157,\"g\nrpc_status\":14,\"referenced_errors\":[{\"created\":\"@1484874109.778562000\",\"description\":\"OS Error\",\"errno\":54,\"file\":\"..\/src\/core\/lib\/iomgr\/tcp_posix.c\",\"file_l\nine\":229,\"os_error\":\"Connection reset by peer\",\"syscall\":\"recvmsg\"}]}\n    at ClientDuplexStream._emitStatusIfDone (\/Users\/yshrini\/Developer\/BlockChain\/work\/src\/github.ibm.com\/IBM-Blockchain\/ProvAAS\/ProvServer\/node_modules\/grpc\/\nsrc\/node\/src\/client.js:189:19)\n    at ClientDuplexStream._receiveStatus (\/Users\/yshrini\/Developer\/BlockChain\/work\/src\/github.ibm.com\/IBM-Blockchain\/ProvAAS\/ProvServer\/node_modules\/grpc\/src\n\/node\/src\/client.js:169:8)\n    at \/Users\/yshrini\/Developer\/BlockChain\/work\/src\/github.ibm.com\/IBM-Blockchain\/ProvAAS\/ProvServer\/node_modules\/grpc\/src\/node\/src\/client.js:634:14\n```","edited":{"user":"U38DC9CCF","ts":"1484916974.000000"},"ts":"1484916955.002415"},{"type":"message","user":"U2ZPJHMNY","text":"<@U0PB67X4K> same issue.

At this point, you are enrolled (so you can't enroll again) but your credentials are local to the SDK and now you can only use the SDK to invoke\/query as the enrollID you used to enroll\n\n- The REST API works differently.  We you call the `\/registrar` endpoint via REST, what happens is the the peer actually acts as a \"wallet\" and enrolls you behind the scenes.  So in this case, the credentials end up being stored on the peer itself (by default in the `\/var\/hyperledge\/production\/client` directory and in your case this would be inside the Docker container)\n\nso the bottom line is that if you enroll via HFC you can't use the ID via the REST API and vice versa - if you enroll via the REST API you can't use that ID via HFC","ts":"1485477054.002853"},{"type":"message","user":"U0YJUECE8","text":"<@U3S8HRGLV>  ^^","ts":"1485477067.002854"},{"type":"message","user":"U0YJUECE8","text":"<@U3S8HRGLV> and from the same conversation I saved:\n\nQ: is there any difference how certificates are used via HFC and REST?\n\nA:  interesting question - the answer is yes and no.  With HFC, the certificates are directly used within the hfc code - meaning you'll actually be submitting signed transactions via GRPC to a fabric peer (and technically you could control usages of trasnacaction certificates, etc).  When using the REST API, the crypto functions are delegated to the peer to act on your behalf (so you submit a REST call with SecureContext in it and then the peer takes that, converts it into a fabric transaction, signs it with the credentials it is storing on your behalf and then submits it)\n\nSo in the end, the system will see the same certificates either way, just that HFC is a more direct and controlled path for a client","ts":"1485477147.002855"},{"user":"U3B52L21K","text":"<@U3B52L21K|ty531> has joined the channel","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","ts":"1485479814.002856"},{"type":"message","user":"U0KPFAZNF","text":"<@U0KM61BCP> <@U0PB67X4K> 64MB compressed.

You can't dynamically define new users with the REST API.   With the SDK on the other hand, you can create new users that aren't in membersrvc.yaml.   I do believe though that with the SDK the administrative user has to be pre-defined in membersrvc.yaml.  E.g. *admin* or *WebAppAdmin* which is typically used in the demo applications.   And even though those admin users are pre-defined in membersrvc.yaml, I think you still have to make an SDK call to register them.

To take the analogy a step further.  *membersrvc.yaml* is like a list of people to invite to the party (i.e., *register*), and the REST API way is kind of saying, I'm only going to invite people who are on that list you've given me, but with the SDK if you're an administrative user, you can invite anybody you want to the party.","ts":"1485505058.002876"},{"type":"message","user":"U3M5K237X","text":"as your party grows - can you edit the membersrvcs yaml ? do you have to make any changes to chain code?","thread_ts":"1485506909.002878","reply_count":1,"replies":[{"user":"U0YJUECE8","ts":"1485526931.002908"}],"ts":"1485506909.002878"},{"type":"message","user":"U2UGBCT89","text":"Yah that makes sense ..Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:","ts":"1485508387.002879"},{"type":"message","user":"U2UGBCT89","text":"And did anyone tried using HFC for creating new user?Have been getting below errors while doing it..","ts":"1485508449.002880"},{"type":"message","user":"U2UGBCT89","text":"protoRegistrar.setId({ id: registrar.getName() });\n                                             ^\n\nTypeError: registrar.getName is not a function\n    at MemberServicesImpl.register (\/opt\/test\/node_modules\/hfc\/lib\/hfc.js:1965:46)\n    at Member.register (\/opt\/test\/node_modules\/hfc\/lib\/hfc.js:726:29)\n    at Member.registerAndEnroll (\/opt\/test\/node_modules\/hfc\/lib\/hfc.js:785:14)\n    at \/opt\/test\/node_modules\/hfc\/lib\/hfc.js:543:20\n    at \/opt\/test\/node_modules\/hfc\/lib\/hfc.js:464:13\n    at \/opt\/test\/node_modules\/hfc\/lib\/hfc.js:493:13\n    at \/opt\/test\/node_modules\/hfc\/lib\/hfc.js:886:13\n    at ReadFileContext.callback (\/opt\/test\/node_modules\/hfc\/lib\/hfc.js:2202:24)\n    at FSReqWrap.readFileAfterOpen [as oncomplete] (fs.js:365:13)\nE0127 09:15:08.147892304    4777 resolve_address_posix.c:126] getaddrinfo: Name or service not known","ts":"1485508522.002881"},{"type":"message","subtype":"file_share","text":"<@U3D5886CB|ruslan> uploaded a file: <https:\/\/hyperledgerproject.slack.com\/files\/ruslan\/F3Y0S7GCF\/hash-of-blocks.png|hash-of-blocks.png> and commented: Why previous hash and Data hash are not equal?
