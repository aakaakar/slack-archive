What sawtooth repo should I be using? Right now i\u2019m using the modules under intelledger\/ from the release on Mar 31st\/v1.1.0. However this release seems to not behave as expected when I do what\u2019s mentioned on the tutorial. For instance -v(verbose) is not included in validator_cli.py among a few more minor things. I tried to fill in aspects that I thought were missing or needed but I don\u2019t want to spend too much time doing that if I can get quicker solutions for it. Am I using the right version of the repo?\n2. Trying to use the validator CLI using launcher.py and save-blockchain and load-blockchain. This script launches x number of validators on the machine and then tries to export state. In context of the tutorial how can I export the blocks I have on a single validator? How can I use save-blockchain\/load-blockchain on a single existing validator.\n3. Finally i know this is an ongoing process but i\u2019m trying to make sure i\u2019m using the latest documentation on this so is there a better place than <https:\/\/intelledger.github.io> for this?\n\nThanks!","ts":"1471929300.000152"},{"type":"message","user":"U231ZGXDG","text":"<@U0N3AJSSU>","ts":"1471929375.000153"},{"type":"message","user":"U231ZGXDG","text":"In retrospect it seems there\u2019s some answers in <#C0J02NU1E|general> but please let me know if i\u2019m not doing this right.","ts":"1471929426.000154"},{"type":"message","user":"U231ZGXDG","text":"thanks.","ts":"1471929427.000155"},{"type":"message","user":"U20A6GBT3","text":"jzou@redpanda:~\/hyperledger\/sawtooth-core\/core$ python setup.py build\n\/home\/jzou\/.local\/lib\/python2.7\/site-packages\/setuptools\/dist.py:364: UserWarning: Normalizing '1.1.1-dev1' to '1.1.1.dev1'\n  normalized_version,\nrunning build\nrunning build_py\nfile journal\/consensus\/poet\/poet_enclave_simulator\/poet_enclave_simulator.py (for module journal.consensus.poet.poet_enclave_simulator.poet_enclave_simulator) not found\nfile gossip\/ECDSA\/ECDSARecoverModule.py (for module gossip.ECDSA.ECDSARecoverModule) not found\nfile journal\/consensus\/poet\/poet_enclave_simulator\/poet_enclave_simulator.py (for module journal.consensus.poet.poet_enclave_simulator.poet_enclave_simulator) not found\nfile gossip\/ECDSA\/ECDSARecoverModule.py (for module gossip.ECDSA.ECDSARecoverModule) not found\nrunning build_ext\nbuilding '_poet_enclave_simulator' extension\nswigging journal\/consensus\/poet\/poet_enclave_simulator\/poet_enclave_simulator.i to journal\/consensus\/poet\/poet_enclave_simulator\/poet_enclave_simulator_wrap.cpp\nswig -python -c++ -o journal\/consensus\/poet\/poet_enclave_simulator\/poet_enclave_simulator_wrap.cpp journal\/consensus\/poet\/poet_enclave_simulator\/poet_enclave_simulator.i\nunable to execute 'swig': No such file or directory\nerror: command 'swig' failed with exit status 1","ts":"1471930301.000156"},{"type":"message","user":"U10QTGLCW","text":"<@U20A6GBT3>: you need to \"apt-get install swig\u201d for sawtooth to build outside of the vagrant environment.

A user can create most MarketPlace objects via the UI, including\nparticipants, assets, holdings and sell offers.\n\nThe Server Backend\n\nThe server is a Node.js application, which uses RethinkDB for its\nstorage needs. It provides API's to create richer representation of the\nmarketplace objects, in order to improve the user experience. It also\nacts as a pass-through for transactions being submitted to a validator.\nAny transaction successfully submitted will be recorded, giving history\nof any failures that may occur during block construction.\n\nThe Synchronization Tool\n\nThe synchronization tool is a python script that bridges the gap between\nblock store contents and a RethinkDB database instance. It reads block\ndeltas from a validator, and creates block store snapshots, essentially\nproviding an immutable history of the block state.","attachments":[{"service_name":"GitHub","title":"hyperledger\/sawtooth-core","title_link":"https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/sawtooth-core\/tree\/master\/extensions\/mktplace\/navigator","text":"sawtooth-core - Core repository for Sawtooth Lake Distributed ledger","fallback":"GitHub: hyperledger\/sawtooth-core","thumb_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/7657900?v=3&s=400","from_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/sawtooth-core\/tree\/master\/extensions\/mktplace\/navigator","thumb_width":142,"thumb_height":142,"service_icon":"https:\/\/github.com\/apple-touch-icon.png","id":1}],"ts":"1478632065.000363"},{"user":"U1VF60BNV","text":"<@U1VF60BNV|madhvesh> has joined the channel","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","ts":"1478647644.000365"},{"type":"message","user":"U1ZUSJHAA","text":"<@U1H7ZPXEW> :+1:","ts":"1478691152.000366"},{"type":"message","user":"U1ZUSJHAA","text":"<@U1H7ZPXEW> <@U1M3199JP> We'd better post these helpful information to the hyperledger-stl maillist.
