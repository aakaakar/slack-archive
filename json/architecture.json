Endorsers have clear-text access and can execute and validate tx. A submitting peer which receives sufficient number of endorsements to meet the endorsement policy will include tx in 2nd phase block-generation at consensus services. The consensus service does not have clear-text access to tx data, and hence cannot validate tx \u2013 it only creates an ordered list of tx for inclusion in a block. (Need a second pass validation to eliminate double-spend tx\u2019s within a proposed block).

Wanted to address the requirement where only a subset of peers (similar to endorsers) execute a transaction, and adopting the state-update concept.\n\nThe aim is to see if the simpler approach has legs. \n\nValidating-set: Set of validating peer nodes that have cleartext access and authorization to execute and validate transactions\nValidation-policy: Rules on what constitutes a valid-tx (similar to endorsement policy)\n\nSmart Contract Function:\nReceives tx from communication layer (unicast from client-node)\nIf this peer is part of validating-set, executes the validation\/business-logic and stores result in scratch-space, if tx is valid. Computes state-update, and optionally includes it in tx sent to network. (In this model, it seems we may not need version-dependencies). Tx is rejected\/tossed if not-valid.\nTransmit tx to network (broadcast to peers) via communication layer\nBlock-creator (leader) role: Creates proposed block \u2013 ordered list of \u201cvalid\" tx. Uses state-update information to eliminate potentially conflicting txs (e.g. Double spend txs would be updating using same key.). Sends block to Consensus layer.\nBlock-validator role: Executes each tx in received block that it is authorized to (I.e. This peer belongs to validating set of tx) and appends it\u2019s \u201cvalidation(endorsement)\u201d to each valid tx. Checks state-update info for inconsistencies for other txs, that it can not execute. Sends validation responses to Consensus layer.\nBlock-committer: Commits all state-updates on completion of consensus\nConsensus Function:\nBlock-creator (leader) role: Receives proposed block from SC function and starts consensus protocol to peer-nodes (broadcast) via communication layer. Ensures validation-policy is enforced. \nBlock-validator role: Receives proposed-block from peer via communication layer, and send to SC function for block-validation \u2013 Uses response in Consensus process and confirms that validation-policy is enforced (Additional round of communication may be needed for confirmation.)\nOutput of Consensus is agreement on ordered set of valid tx. If Block contains hash of global-state, also verifies global state is consistent. If Consensus is not reached tx returned to \u201cmempool\u201d?\nPlease review and lets discuss by e-mail and on the arch-WG call on Wednesday.","ts":"1465326011.000008"},{"user":"U1F16MNH0","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U1F16MNH0|norbs> has joined the channel","ts":"1465362472.000009"},{"user":"U155ZCE21","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U155ZCE21|shrein> has joined the channel","ts":"1465386114.000010"},{"user":"U0P1VU0QG","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0P1VU0QG|ikruiper> has joined the channel","ts":"1465388737.000011"},{"type":"message","user":"U0KM97TRP","text":"Webex link for meeting at 9 AM call: <https:\/\/cisco.webex.com\/ciscosales\/e.php?MTID=m4c8de547c4824438a65ea23144baea68>","attachments":[{"title":"Cisco - Internal Sites WebEx Enterprise Site","title_link":"https:\/\/cisco.webex.com\/ciscosales\/e.php?MTID=m4c8de547c4824438a65ea23144baea68","text":"6","fallback":"Cisco - Internal Sites WebEx Enterprise Site","from_url":"https:\/\/cisco.webex.com\/ciscosales\/e.php?MTID=m4c8de547c4824438a65ea23144baea68","service_icon":"https:\/\/cisco.webex.com\/favicont29.ico","service_name":"cisco.webex.com","id":1}],"ts":"1465400901.000012"},{"type":"message","user":"U0KM97TRP","text":"Meeting number: 208 983 747 \nMeeting password: EJP23Ui2","ts":"1465400931.000014"},{"type":"message","user":"U0KM97TRP","text":"Link to Notes Google Doc: <https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/139zLiMCJBLYVFR4dQd_2UqJOyJVEBjAB8PwxIwV6Wf0\/edit?usp=sharing>","ts":"1465401230.000015"},{"user":"U16NDNH08","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U16NDNH08|crow15> has joined the channel","ts":"1465402329.000016"},{"user":"U1FC1UZPS","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U1FC1UZPS|subir> has joined the channel","ts":"1465460422.000018"},{"type":"message","user":"U0KM97TRP","text":"Lets try to see if we can have a working session to coincide with the virtual-Hackathon","ts":"1465487421.000019"},{"type":"message","user":"U0KM97TRP","text":"<http:\/\/doodle.com\/poll\/wav9rhin5rc58txx>","attachments":[{"title":"Doodle: Arch-WG working session","title_link":"http:\/\/doodle.com\/poll\/wav9rhin5rc58txx","text":"Working session during the virtual hackathon","fallback":"Doodle: Arch-WG working session","image_url":"http:\/\/doodle.com\/graphics\/static\/facebookSharingThumbnail.png","from_url":"http:\/\/doodle.com\/poll\/wav9rhin5rc58txx","image_width":300,"image_height":200,"image_bytes":6864,"service_icon":"http:\/\/doodle.com\/builtstatic\/1465286543\/doodle\/graphics\/doodle-57.png","service_name":"Doodle","id":1}],"ts":"1465487425.000020"},{"user":"U1FHHDHD4","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U1FHHDHD4|chrisb> has joined the channel","ts":"1465497253.000022"},{"user":"U1FRY7UGM","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U1FRY7UGM|junjason> has joined the channel","ts":"1465571930.000023"},{"user":"U1FU2880L","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U1FU2880L|gabelev> has joined the channel","ts":"1465585448.000024"},{"user":"U1G473B9S","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U1G473B9S|shannon> has joined the channel","ts":"1465697730.000002"},{"user":"U1F2LURR6","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U1F2LURR6|ulysses> has joined the channel","ts":"1465794262.000003"},{"user":"U1G86QUSG","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U1G86QUSG|kpatch> has joined the channel","ts":"1465799847.000004"},{"type":"message","user":"U0KM97TRP","text":"So far Friday 9 AM PT has the most votes.
