So if validation fails because the version of keys has changed, the transaction is recorded in the ledger but flagged as \u2018not valid\u2019?

It stores a balance, and allows debits and credits to the account. Debits are only allowed if the balance is greater than or equal to the amount being debited. \nThe account balance starts with the value 100.\n- Credit(50) (balance now 150).\n- Debit(120) (balance now 30).\n\nIf there is a delay between the credit and debit, such that the credit is committed to the blockchain, then the debit will succeed. \nIf the debit is invoked immediately after the credit without delay, then it will likely fail (as the balance is still 100 as the credit has not been committed). Similar to other non-blockchain systems.\n\nNow, if we change the transactions to just 2 credits:\n- Credit(50)\n- Credit(20)\n\nSimilar to before, if there is a delay between to the credits, then they will succeed.
