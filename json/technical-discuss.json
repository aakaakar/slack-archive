It introduces a concept called 'Proof of Understanding', intended to (partially) replace proof of work for creating immutability and allowing different machines and applications with different languages and protocols to interact.\n\nBasic technical idea is: we use a blockchain as a supervised training set to predict future message formats based on previous transactions message formats. For new Connections sender &amp; receiver have to run through an agreement and negotiation process (format, content, action handshake) to agree on how they communicate. The Miner (called here Translator) is responsible for suggesting message formats and upon success gets rewarded in a cryptocurrency. Successful and un-successful handshakes together with relevant features allowing predictions based on Machine Learning algorithms get recorded in the Blockchain.  \n\nPartially replacing 'proof of work' with 'proof of understanding' (calling the resulting System Babelchain after Hitchhiker's babelfish) will allow a smarter and maybe lesser use of Machine energy consumption and via connecting before hands unconnected systems has the potential to disrupt some quasi monopolistic information silos.\n\nThis idea is in a white paper status and would need to be prototyped.
